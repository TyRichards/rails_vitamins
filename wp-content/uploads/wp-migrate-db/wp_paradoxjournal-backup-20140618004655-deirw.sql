We&#8217;re trying our hardest to save your content somewhere even if your power goes out or your browser crashes. We even monitor your internet connection and prevent you from hitting that &#8220;Publish&#8221; button at the exact moment the coffee shop Wi-Fi has a hiccup.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s <em>possible</em> that the quick draft you lost last week is still in the database, and just hidden from view. As an added complication, these &#8220;discarded drafts&#8221; normally get deleted after seven days, and it&#8217;s already been six days since the release. If we were able to rescue your draft, you&#8217;ll see it on the &#8220;All Posts&#8221; screen after you update to 3.8.3. (We&#8217;ll also be pushing 3.8.3 out as a background update, so you may just see a draft appear.)</p>\n<p>So, if you tried to jot down a quick idea last week, I hope WordPress has recovered it for you.

Despite the iconic name, the Eighties theme is not actually a tribute to big hair, leg warmers and the Cold War.

It was designed to keep the menu and sidebar out of the way until the visitor toggles them into view.</p>\n<p>The theme offers just a couple of customization options to make it your own, including the ability to set your own header and header text color. You can add widgets to the pop out sidebar area or the footer. It ships with the image you see in the header, so making your site look exactly like the demo takes no time at all.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/eighties-customizer.png" rel="prettyphoto[24812]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/eighties-customizer.png?resize=1025%2C557" alt="eighties-customizer" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-24819" /></a></p>\n<p>Eighties includes support for several Jetpack modules. <a href="http://eighties.me/portfolio/" target="_blank">Portfolios</a> are a unique feature included in this theme if you use Jetpack (coming soon) or blog on WordPress.com.

After a few consultation emails and deliberation, the developers have decided the plugin <a title="http://versionpress.wordpress.com/2014/06/16/announcing-full-gpl-licensing/" href="http://versionpress.wordpress.com/2014/06/16/announcing-full-gpl-licensing/">will be 100% GPL licensed</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When we set off with <a href="http://versionpress.net/">VersionPress </a>and the crowd-funding campaign for it, we were focused on technical things and wanted to postpone the final decision on licensing. That was a mistake and you let us know loud and clear. We heard you and have an important and exciting announcement to make today: <strong>VersionPress will be 100% GNU GPL-licensed</strong>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is fantastic news and I hope those who are on the fence will consider <a title="http://versionpress.net/" href="http://versionpress.net/">backing the project</a>. For those that don&#8217;t know, the GPLv2 license gives users and developers a set of freedoms. Since <a title="http://wordpress.org/about/license/" href="http://wordpress.org/about/license/">WordPress is licensed under the GPL</a>, these same freedoms are passed on to everyone who uses or develops the software.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).</li>\n<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>\n<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).</li>\n<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg has a <a title="http://ma.tt/2014/01/four-freedoms/" href="http://ma.tt/2014/01/four-freedoms/">great article</a> that articulates the significance of these freedoms. When VersionPress announced they were unsure of whether to license the plugin under the GPL, it&#8217;s not because they wanted to create something proprietary. It&#8217;s because they are two software developers outside of the WordPress community, unsure of how WordPress and its community works.</p>\n<h3>Helping Newcomers Understand Why The GPL License Is Important</h3>\n<p>After I published the article about VersionPress on WP Tavern last week, several people voiced their concern over the lack of licensing details. I got in touch with Borek Bernard and explained why so many people are concerned. I explained what the GPL means to the project and the WordPress community in general. I cited examples of successful WordPress product businesses that use the GPL.</p>\n<p>There are two camps of people. Those who know and understand the importance of the GPL and those who don&#8217;t care what license a product has as long as it works and is supported well. At this stage of the game, WordPress products not GPL licensed are at a serious disadvantage. You won&#8217;t get as much press and risk being ignored by influential members of the community. This is especially true for new products entering the market.</p>\n<h3>I Backed The Project With $20 and Here&#8217;s Why</h3>\n<p>Despite a working copy of VersionPress not being publicly available, I feel the same amount of excitement for the project that I did when I was given a GravityForms demonstration in 2009. I&#8217;m told there are already plugins available that provide <a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/search.php?q=version+control" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/search.php?q=version+control">version control</a> but most of them deal with content, not with the database itself. After listening to Bernard explain some of the features and how it would work in <a title="http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-151-version-control-for-all-maybe" href="http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-151-version-control-for-all-maybe">episode 151 of WordPress Weekly</a>, I&#8217;m even more excited to see the project succeed.</p>\n<div id="attachment_24813" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/VersionPressMonitorLog.png" rel="prettyphoto[24810]"><img class="size-full wp-image-24813" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/VersionPressMonitorLog.png?resize=525%2C330" alt="VersionPress Monitor Log" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">VersionPress Monitor Log</p></div>\n<p>For example, let&#8217;s say there&#8217;s a change you&#8217;d like to undo but you&#8217;ve published five posts since the change. Normally, you&#8217;d have to restore a backup which would reset the entire site back to that time frame. With VersionPress, you&#8217;d be able to drill down and only undo that change without losing everything that happened after it. In a future version, it could be possible to undo changes at the user level.</p>\n<p>This type of granular control over database changes is huge, especially if the interface is as simple as selecting an undo button. This plugin potentially has mass appeal but I fear that a lot of users wouldn&#8217;t understand the changes being registered to the database. Hopefully, the interface does a good job of pin-pointing what parts of WordPress are altering the database to make it easier to understand.</p>\n<h3>Getting Site Wide Revision Control In Core Will Be Difficult</h3>\n<p>Even if VersionPress doesn&#8217;t get off the ground, I&#8217;ve now been exposed to the idea and will highly support any developer or team of developers to create something like it. WordPress has support for <a title="http://codex.wordpress.org/Revisions" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Revisions">Post Revisions</a> but again, that deals with content and not with other changes throughout the site. At some point, it would be great to see a revisions API built into WordPress that can monitor revisions of more than just content. Plugins could then take advantage of the API and build on top of it. There could be multiple implementations of VersionPress to choose from.</p>\n<p>The road to getting something like site wide revisions into core will be difficult. In 2013, <a href="http://yrnxt.com/" target="_blank">Alexander Höreth</a> participated in the Google Summer of Code project for WordPress. His project was the <a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/code-revisions/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/code-revisions/">Code Revisions plugin</a> which would have added revision support to the code editors in WordPress. His work was never added to the core of WordPress. If that&#8217;s anything to go by, extending revision support to other areas of core may be just a pipe dream.</p>\n<p>That discussion took place nine months ago. Let&#8217;s start a new discussion on the positives and negatives of a site wide revision system in core. I know there are security issues to take note of but what other concerns do you have for such a system?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 04:38:58 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"WPTavern: Forbes Publishes Transcript Of Extended Interview With Matt Mullenweg";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=24678";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:202:"http://wptavern.com/forbes-publishes-transcript-of-extended-interview-with-matt-mullenweg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=forbes-publishes-transcript-of-extended-interview-with-matt-mullenweg";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5763:"<p>Typically when reading interviews people have done with Matt Mullenweg, I don&#8217;t learn anything new. That&#8217;s the not the case with the <a title="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jjcolao/2014/06/11/an-extended-interview-with-wordpress-creator-matt-mullenweg/" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jjcolao/2014/06/11/an-extended-interview-with-wordpress-creator-matt-mullenweg/">extended interview he did</a> with J.J. Colao of Forbes.com. In the interview, Mullenweg goes into detail about his role of CEO at Automattic and emphasized how important mobile is within the company. Here are a few things I took away from the interview.</p>\n<div id="attachment_22370" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/automattic-offices.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[24678]"><img class="size-full wp-image-22370" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/automattic-offices.jpg?resize=1025%2C478" alt="photo credit: Peter Slutsky" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo credit: <a href="http://peterslutsky.com/2013/05/14/pics-touring-automattics-new-office/">Peter Slutsky</a></p></div>\n<p>When people ask how does Automattic make money, I tell them through advertising, paid upgrades, and the VIP partner program. Mullenweg specified that WordAds and the VIP program are each 10% of the total revenue Automattic generates. Meanwhile, subscriptions make up 80% of the revenue. This makes sense but I was surprised subscriptions were that high of a percentage. I thought VIP generated the most revenue for the company based on what they charge and the types of clients they have. Then again, there are more regular users than there are VIP clients.</p>\n<p>One thing that hasn&#8217;t changed with the move to CEO is that Mullenweg still spends about a third of his time conducting interviews with new employees. If you&#8217;re interested in <a title="http://automattic.com/work-with-us/" href="http://automattic.com/work-with-us/">working for Automattic</a>, now is as good a time as ever to apply since the company is aggressively growing as fast as they find the best people.</p>\n<h3>Transforming Automattic Into a Mobile Company</h3>\n<p>Over the past two years, the one constant I&#8217;ve noticed in almost every interview featuring Mullenweg is his focus on mobile. This interview is no different. While Automattic has been aggressive in mobile acquisitions and new hires, the company will be training existing engineers to be mobile first. The entire company will be a mobile team instead of consisting of 10 individuals.</p>\n<blockquote><p>So in addition to our aggressive hiring on the mobile side and acquisitions, we’re going to start converting our existing engineers to be mobile first. I would hate to have to do this at a 20,000-person company because it’s hard enough as 200-person company.</p>\n<p>The mobile world is very closed and proprietary just by definition. Android is open source-ish but not really. iOS is locked down. I want to be more of a mobile company but as we do that I don’t want to lose the things that make us the engine of the independent Web.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Is It Time For Two WordPress Mobile Apps?</h3>\n<p>As Automattic continues to increase its focus on mobile, I wonder what the future holds for the current mobile app. I use it primarily as a site management tool and not to consume content. Since Automattic loves data, I wonder if they have internal stats that show whether the WordPress mobile app is used more for managing sites or consuming content.</p>\n<div id="attachment_24807" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/WPMobileAppComposingScreen.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[24678]"><img class="size-full wp-image-24807" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/WPMobileAppComposingScreen.jpg?resize=1025%2C769" alt="WordPress Mobile App For iOS Compose Screen" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">WordPress Mobile App For iOS Compose Screen</p></div>\n<p>If the data shows that most people use it as a site management tool, I&#8217;d like them to consider removing Reader and the blogs I follow feature set from the app and moved into a separate WordPress.com focused app. I never use Reader, I&#8217;m not following any blogs, and I don&#8217;t have any friends on WordPress.com making almost half the app useless to me.</p>\n<p>I understand that WordPress.com and the open source WordPress project have similar feature sets, but I don&#8217;t think one app can satisfy both audiences without one or the other getting stuck with unused portions of the application. An alternative would be to create a WordPress Lite application that only gives me the features I need to manage a site. Unfortunately, every time there&#8217;s a decent alternative to the WordPress mobile app, Automattic <a title="http://venturebeat.com/2013/06/17/automattic-buys-poster-app/" href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/06/17/automattic-buys-poster-app/">acquires them</a>.</p>\n<p>Overall, it&#8217;s a <a title="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jjcolao/2014/06/11/an-extended-interview-with-wordpress-creator-matt-mullenweg/" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jjcolao/2014/06/11/an-extended-interview-with-wordpress-creator-matt-mullenweg/">great interview</a> but I wish the full transcript of 13,500 words was available versus 2,800. It&#8217;s also reassuring to read Mullenweg&#8217;s response when asked whether he will be with Automattic for life: &#8220;Yes. I’m kind of a one trick pony.&#8221;</p>\n<p>What do you think of splitting the app in two? Could it work or would it be too confusing? Should I give it the WordPress treatment and just ignore those areas of the app I don&#8217;t use?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 01:22:37 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"WPTavern: Experimental BuddyPress Plugin Adds Finer Controls for Public Groups";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=24769";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:200:"http://wptavern.com/experimental-buddypress-plugin-adds-finer-controls-for-public-groups?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=experimental-buddypress-plugin-adds-finer-controls-for-public-groups";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5729:"<div id="attachment_24792" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/group.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[24769]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/group.jpg?resize=1025%2C525" alt="photo credit: avrene - cc" class="size-full wp-image-24792" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/enerva/14186751646/">avrene</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">cc</a></p></div>\n<p><a href="http://buddypress.org/about/groups/" target="_blank">BuddyPress Groups</a> are one of the more social components of the plugin, as they&#8217;re used primarily for bringing members together around a shared interest, goal, or collaborative project. In some ways groups are like their own mini-networks within a social network, each having its own homepage, activity stream, member directory and administrative panel.</p>\n<p>Groups are a highly effective way of organizing members and as such have been extended to serve a multitude of different requirements. Search WordPress.org and you&#8217;ll find a couple dozen pages of <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/search.php?page=4&q=buddypress+groups" target="_blank">plugins devoted to BuddyPress groups</a>, with extensions that add new functionality, such as email subscriptions, documents, reviews, blogs, chat, and so much more. We&#8217;re going to look at how the basic group settings can be changed in order to provide more pathways for the creation of different kinds of groups.</p>\n<h3>A Brief Overview of BuddyPress Group Privacy Options</h3>\n<p>BuddyPress has three privacy options for setting up groups: Public, Private, or Hidden. When you create a group at /groups/create, you&#8217;ll find the privacy options located under settings.</p>\n<p>Anyone can join a public group and all of the activity and content are public. Private groups require users to request membership, while hidden groups are invitation only. Private and hidden groups are similar in that the group content and activity will only be visible to members. Unlike public and private groups, a hidden group is not listed in the groups directory or search results.</p>\n<p>Not all groups fit neatly into these three privacy options. That&#8217;s why BuddyPress core developer Mathieu Viet (<a href="https://twitter.com/imath" target="_blank">@imath</a>) has created a new experimental plugin to allow for a different combination of these settings.</p>\n<h3>Alternative Public Group Control</h3>\n<p>One problem with the way private groups are structured is that potential members cannot see any content or any of the other members in the group. This is a bit off putting and doesn&#8217;t help to attract new group members.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/private-group.png" rel="prettyphoto[24769]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/private-group.png?resize=900%2C442" alt="private-group" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-24782" /></a></p>\n<p>When examining the BuddyPress core, @imath found it difficult to override the way private groups are structured. Instead, he opted to extend public groups and the <a href="https://github.com/imath/altctrl-public-group" target="_blank">Alternative Public Group Control</a> plugin was born.</p>\n<p>This new experimental plugin gives admins more fine-grained control over public groups. It doesn&#8217;t override the group creation process but rather creates a new control tab within the group admin with three additional options.</p>\n<p>The first allows you to require users to request membership in order to join, a feature previously limited to private groups. The second option is the ability to make certain group tabs visible to members only, ie. members, docs, attachments, etc.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/group-admin-control.png" rel="prettyphoto[24769]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/group-admin-control.png?resize=1025%2C775" alt="group-admin-control" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-24785" /></a></p>\n<p>The last option included in the plugin is the convenient way to create a simple custom homepage which will be displayed when non-members are viewing the group.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/custom-homepage.png" rel="prettyphoto[24769]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/custom-homepage.png?resize=900%2C377" alt="custom-homepage" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-24787" /></a></p>\n<p>This optional homepage space is useful if you want to further explain the process of joining the group or elaborate a bit more on what participation entails. Previously, the only place to do this was in the group&#8217;s description, which is better left short and sweet for its listing in the groups directory.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://github.com/imath/altctrl-public-group" target="_blank">Alternative Public Group Control</a> plugin offers greater flexibility to groups with unique requirements. If you need more control over your groups and want to try out this plugin, your can download it from GitHub.  Be advised that it&#8217;s still experimental. If you have feedback, please send it to <a href="https://twitter.com/imath" target="_blank">@imath</a> by posting in the issues queue. Want to see the plugin in action without installing it?

A &#8220;Beta Testing&#8221; tab now lists all available <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/features-as-plugins/" target="_blank">Feature Plugins</a> that are currently ready for testing, including the WP API, Press This, and WordPress Frontend Editor plugins.</p>\n<div id="attachment_24758" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/beta-testing.png" rel="prettyphoto[24751]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/beta-testing.png?resize=1025%2C555" alt="photo credit: Ryan McCue" class="size-full wp-image-24758" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo credit: Ryan McCue</p></div>\n<p>Andrew Nacin <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28513" target="_blank">added the tab</a> to all development builds of WordPress. To be clear, this is a tab meant only for those who are testing the plugins with the bleeding edge versions of WordPress and it will not be rolled into the next release. The Beta Testing tab is also visible if you&#8217;re using develop.svn/git.wordpress.org, even if you&#8217;re running a stable version of these builds. He chose to omit the WordPress Beta Tester plugin, given that you&#8217;re probably already on a beta track if you can view the new tab.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;I could also see us adding a &#8216;Development&#8217; tab that lists plugins like Debug Bar and Log Deprecated Notices. (Again, only if not on a stable build),&#8221;</strong> Nacin noted in the ticket. This could be very convenient for developers who want to quickly grab recommended tools, instead of having to remember and search them all individually.</p>\n<p>The new Beta Testing tab is a welcome addition and will hopefully get more eyes on new features that are in development for future releases. As long as the screen is regularly updated, developers running WordPress trunk will always know which feature plugins have testing versions available, without having to subscribe to all the development updates.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 16 Jun 2014 16:15:01

href="http://themefurnace.com/" target="_blank">ThemeFurnace</a> relaunched this week with a complete overhaul of its theme collection. The shop was founded in 2012 by Oliver Dale, a Manchester-based designer and entrepreneur. In addition to a new website and pricing structure, Dale and his team have recoded all of their existing themes to remove the old options panel in favor of using WordPress&#8217; native customizer.</p>\n<p>Themes developed with their own options panels aren&#8217;t necessarily bad. However, the growing consensus among theme developers is that utilizing the customizer is the now considered to be the best practice. Commercial theme companies are starting to embrace this in order to simplify their themes and remain competitive.</p>\n<p>Recoding the entire ThemeFurance collection to use the customizer has been quite an undertaking, Dale said. The team has finished 11 themes so far and another five are still in process. He believes that this will make the themes easier to use, which in turn lessens the support burden.</p>\n<p>Dale told the Tavern that ThemeFurnace will be releasing a free WordPress.org theme for every new theme they create from now on. <strong>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen great results with our two free themes in the directory so far,&#8221;</strong> he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the only way I can contribute back to WordPress, which has treated me so well, and it helps get our name out there to people who wouldn&#8217;t normally see it.&#8221; Customers who buy the commercial versions will be entitled to support and a few extra customization options.</p>\n<h3>ThemeFurnace Bets Heavy on Club Pricing Model</h3>\n<p>While many WordPress theme shops have started moving away from the club pricing model, the folks at ThemeFurnace have decided to embrace it. This week&#8217;s relaunch introduces a lifetime club membership <a href="http://themefurnace.com/pricing/" target="_blank">pricing option</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The reason we moved to the clubs membership was the vast majority of purchases were for single themes at $49 each,&#8221; Dale said. &#8220;So we figured that&#8217;s a good price people are willing to pay, so if we offer the whole collection for $49, it can only increase sales and that puts our themes on more websites,&#8221; he explained.</p>\n<p>Many WordPress product and service companies have <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-managed-host-nodeki-goes-bust-no-refunds-for-lifetime-customers" target="_blank">collapsed</a> under the burden of support for lifetime customers who no longer generate any revenue but continue to utilize company resources. Dale is convinced that ThemeFurnace will not be negatively impacted by the new lifetime membership option.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;I think the support burden has been overplayed as an excuse to put prices up. I find that people need less support as time goes on so I&#8217;m quite happy to offer this new plan,&#8221;</strong> he said.</p>\n<p>Do you think lifetime membership packages are a death knell for theme companies, or are there some unique cases where it might work?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 14 Jun 2014 05:02:13 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 151 – Version Control For All (Maybe)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"http://wptavern.com?p=24717&preview_id=24717";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:164:"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-151-version-control-for-all-maybe?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wpweekly-episode-151-version-control-for-all-maybe";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3680:"<p><a href="http://marcuscouch.com/" title="http://marcuscouch.com/">Marcus Couch</a> and I were joined by <a href="http://versionpress.net/" title="http://versionpress.net/">VersionPress</a> developer, Borek Bernard, to give us the scoop on not only the VersionPress campaign, but what the aim is for the plugin.

Ordinarily, you might first search for a Photoshop template for the specific devices that you need for your mockups. Then you&#8217;d most likely take screenshots, cut them up and place them within the Photoshop file.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, if your site is running on WordPress, there&#8217;s a new free tool that makes it super easy to create device mockups directly within the post or page editor. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/device-mockups/" target="_blank">Device Mockups</a> plugin uses shortcodes to display screenshots, videos, or any content within a responsive device.</p>\n<p>For example, you can surround a screenshot with a device by placing it within the appropriate shortcode:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate">[device type="macbook"]&lt;img src="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/tavern-screenshot-mbp.png" alt="tavern-screenshot-mbp"/&gt;\n[/device]</pre>\n<p>That shortcode would output the screenshot as if it were being displayed on a retina Macbook Pro:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/tavern-mbp-mockup.png" rel="prettyphoto[24676]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/tavern-mbp-mockup.png?resize=1025%2C627" alt="tavern-mbp-mockup" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-24683" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin even supports a &#8220;stacked&#8221; parameter in the shortcode so that you can add multiple devices to the end result. You can mix and match devices as needed to create custom mockups.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/multiple-devices.png" rel="prettyphoto[24676]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/multiple-devices.png?resize=1025%2C643" alt="multiple-devices" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-24691" /></a></p>\n<p>All of the available shortcodes can be found on the plugin&#8217;s <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/device-mockups/" target="_blank">details page</a>. You can also access them via a button in the visual editor:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/visual-editor.png" rel="prettyphoto[24676]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/visual-editor.png?resize=1025%2C529" alt="visual-editor" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-24697" /></a></p>\n<p>The Device Mockups plugin has support for the following devices, and recommended image sizes are included to help you prepare your screenshots:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone 5 &#8211; 640×1136</li>\n<li>iPad &#8211; 2048×1536</li>\n<li>iMac &#8211; 1920&#215;1200</li>\n<li>Macbook Pro (Retina) &#8211; 1440&#215;900</li>\n<li>Galaxy S3 &#8211; 720&#215;1280</li>\n<li>Nexus 7 &#8211; 1920&#215;1200</li>\n<li>Surface &#8211; 1920 x 1080</li>\n<li>Lumia 920 &#8211; 768 x 1280</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to create some responsive mockups for your WordPress site or product, then this tool should save you a good amount of time. This is especially true if you&#8217;re not well-versed in image editing programs like Photoshop where device mockups might present a true challenge.</p>\n<p>If you like the Device Mockups plugin, make sure to thank its developer, <a href="http://byjust.in/" target="_blank">Justin Peacock</a>, who has already committed several updates since its release. You can <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/device-mockups/" target="_blank">download</a> the plugin for free from WordPress.org. Any issues can be submitted on <a href="https://github.com/mrdink/device-mockups/issues"

WordPress 3.7 introduced automatic updates, a <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/10/25/the-definitive-guide-to-disabling-auto-updates-in-wordpress-3-7/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/10/25/the-definitive-guide-to-disabling-auto-updates-in-wordpress-3-7/">segment of users pushed back</a> arguing they should be opt-in instead of opt-out. The main concern being that a website administrator wouldn&#8217;t have any time to test the update to make sure it doesn&#8217;t break anything. Several users said they would be fine with automatic updates if there was an easy way to roll-back to an earlier version if it caused problems. Unfortunately, WordPress doesn&#8217;t have a way to easily roll back updates.</p>\n<p>Two individuals are working together to bring easy, WordPress version control, to the masses. The project is called <a title="http://versionpress.net/" href="http://versionpress.net/">VersionPress</a> and is being spearheaded by two software developers in the Czech Republic, <a href="https://twitter.com/borekb">Borek Bernard</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JanVoracek">Jan Voráček</a>.</p>\n<div id="attachment_24640" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ConceptImage.png" rel="prettyphoto[24596]"><img class="size-full wp-image-24640" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ConceptImage.png?resize=525%2C330" alt="Concept Image For Version Control" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image Showing The Prototype Of VersionPress In Action</p></div>\n<p>According to the home page for the project, VersionPress is a <strong>version control plugin</strong> for WordPress. It keeps the whole site in a Git repository enabling things like <strong>site-wide reverts, safe updates, </strong>and<strong> easy staging</strong>.</p>\n<div id="attachment_24642" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/VersionPressFeatures.png" rel="prettyphoto[24596]"><img class="size-full wp-image-24642" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/VersionPressFeatures.png?resize=970%2C192" alt="A Few Of The Features Of VersionPress" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A Few Of The Features Of VersionPress</p></div>\n<p><a href="https://twitter.com/borekb">Bernard</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JanVoracek">Voráček</a> are taking the crowd funding approach to not only raise the funds necessary to develop the plugin, but to gauge interest. I asked Bernard, if the project doesn&#8217;t reach its <strong>goal of $30k</strong> by the <strong>end of June</strong> will they continue to develop the plugin? &#8220;If the funding goal is not reached, it will depend on things like what was the overall feedback and what percentage of the funding goal we reached. We&#8217;ll do everything to build it but we&#8217;ll certainly need help.&#8221; he replied.</p>\n<h3>Details Of The Crowdfunding Campaign</h3>\n<p>The team has not decided on whether the plugin will be available for free or for a price. However, starting with the $20 donation, you&#8217;ll be given a working copy of the plugin when it&#8217;s finished along with a single-site license. This way, if it turns out to be a commercial plugin, donators will have already paid the price. Donation amounts range from $5 to $10,000 with different perks at each level. The <a title="http://versionpress.net/#campaign" href="http://versionpress.net/#campaign">campaign</a> is only 6% funded ($1,750) with 17 days left to go. If the total amount of funds are not reached by the end of the campaign, all funds will be returned.</p>\n<h3>This Could Be The Next Big Thing</h3>\n<p>While I haven&#8217;t had access to the prototype and haven&#8217;t seen the plugin in action, the ideas and features presented on the page are exciting. While there are ways to obtain version control already, they usually involve geek speak and are not user-friendly. In a perfect world, every site built with WordPress has version control.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d love to see this project funded to see how it turns out not only to obtain a full working copy of the plugin, but to see the implementation and UI elements. At some point in the future, I think WordPress will have core functionality for snapshots or version control. VersionPress could be a great real-world experiment for how it could work in core.</p>\n<p>If VersionPress interests you, be sure to read <a title="http://versionpress.net/" href="http://versionpress.net/">the homepage</a> which provides more information about the campaign. If you have any questions about the campaign or project, you can leave them in the comments or use the contact form at the bottom of the homepage.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 13 Jun 2014 15:15:41 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:95:"WPTavern: WordPress Tip: Use the WP Local Dev Environment Plugin to Disable External Data Calls";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=24646";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:232:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-tip-use-the-wp-local-dev-environment-plugin-to-disable-external-data-calls?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-tip-use-the-wp-local-dev-environment-plugin-to-disable-external-data-calls";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1597:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/off.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[24646]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/off.jpg?resize=1024%2C490" alt="photo credit: Orange Steeler - cc" class="size-full wp-image-24664" /></a></p>\n<p>When developing locally without an internet connection, it doesn&#8217;t make much sense for WordPress to load external files like fonts or Gravatars.

src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/subtitle-example.png?resize=1025%2C458" alt="subtitle-example" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-24625" /></a></p>\n<p>In the past, adding subtitles to WordPress posts always required something a little hacky. Sometimes theme authors would hijack post excerpts or use custom fields in order to accomplish it, but these methods made process of adding a subtitle confusing for users.</p>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/philiparthurmoore/Subtitles" target="_blank">Subtitles</a> is a new free plugin created by WordPress developer <a href="https://twitter.com/philip_arthur" target="_blank">Philip Arthur Moore</a>. It lets you easily add subtitles to WordPress content, including posts, pages, and even custom post types.</p>\n<p>Although there are several subtitle plugins already available on WordPress.org, the best feature about this one is that you don&#8217;t have to add any template tags to your theme in order to display subtitles. The Subtitles plugin just works &#8211; no theme tweaks or coding required.</p>\n<p>Once installed you&#8217;ll find a new place in the WordPress editor for adding subtitles:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/subtitles-with-bacon.png" rel="prettyphoto[24605]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/subtitles-with-bacon.png?resize=900%2C364" alt="subtitles-with-bacon" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-24612" /></a></p>\n<p>After you add a subtitle to a post and save it, you&#8217;ll see it added to the frontend. Here&#8217;s one example using the Fictive theme. However, it really doesn&#8217;t matter what theme you&#8217;re using; the plugin will automatically output your subtitles in a matching style.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/subtitles-frontend.png" rel="prettyphoto[24605]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/subtitles-frontend.png?resize=900%2C401" alt="subtitles-frontend" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-24614" /></a></p>\n<h3>Customizing Subtitles</h3>\n<p>Subtitles will show up in singular, post archives, search results, and can be further extended to display in other views, such as widgets. The markup outputted for them is a span with a specific class you can use to customize their display:</p>\n<pre class="brush: xml; light: true; title: ; notranslate">&lt;span class="entry-subtitle"&gt;Your snappy subtitle&lt;/span&gt;</pre>\n<p>This makes it super easy for theme developers to add support for subtitles. If you already have subtitles built into your theme, you can make it leaner by cutting out the hacky methods and adding support for the Subtitles plugin instead.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;re also not locked into the markup it generates. The markup can be changed by hooking a custom output function to subtitle_markup. An <a href="https://github.com/philiparthurmoore/Subtitles#modifying-subtitles-markup" target="_blank">example</a> is shown in the plugin&#8217;s documentation.</p>\n<p>Subtitles are stored in post meta in your database. If you deactivate the plugin or uninstall it, your database will still keep these entries in case you ever decide to use the plugin again. Moore is considering adding an option to a future release of the plugin that would allow you to clean the subtitles post meta from your database.</p>\n<p>Subtitles is currently the most well-documented, extensible plugin available for adding subtitles to your WordPress site. It&#8217;s available for <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/subtitles/" target="_blank">download</a> on WordPress.org and you can also find it on <a href="https://github.com/philiparthurmoore/Subtitles" target="_blank">GiHub</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 12 Jun 2014 21:14:24 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"Ping-O-Matic: Tips on Growth From a Book Blogger";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://blog.pingomatic.com/?p=107";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"http://blog.pingomatic.com/2014/06/12/book-blogger-tips/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4569:"<p><a href="http://101books.net/"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-108" alt="" src="http://pingomatic.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/screen-shot-2014-03-06-at-12-13-28-pm.png?w=600&h=107" /></a><br />\nOver on <a href="https://dailypost.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"><em>The Daily Post</em></a>, we’ve published interviews with writers on growth and readership. Robert Bruce, the blogger behind the popular book site, <a href="http://101books.net/" target="_blank"><em>101 Books</em></a>, shared bits of advice on building a loyal readership and successful niche blog. Here are snippets from his Q&amp;A:</p>\n<h3>You&#8217;ve got over 26,000 followers and counting. What&#8217;s your secret?</h3>\n<p>There’s really no secret. It’s just steady, consistent posting over a long period of time. <em>101 Books</em> is more than three years old now, and I’ve had more than 700 posts. When you post that often, people are bound to find you. Then, the key is to just write content that relates to them. Most people don’t care about what you had for breakfast, but if you can help them learn something new, then they’ll keep coming back.</p>\n<h3>What types of posts perform better?</h3>\n<p>The funny thing about my blog is that, even though it’s centered on <a href="http://101books.net/faq/" target="_blank">the “101 Books” project</a>, these book reviews don’t perform as well as the quirkier stuff. One of the most popular posts I’ve had was a post about <a href="http://101books.net/2013/04/26/my-2-year-old-judges-books-by-their-covers/" target="_blank">my two-year-old son judging books by their covers</a>. I put a couple of classic book covers in front of him and asked him what he thought they were about. His answers were hilarious. That post took about 15 minutes to put together, but because it was unique and fresh, it became a hit.</p>\n<p>Obviously, list-style posts do well, and I probably tend to overuse them because of that. (I’m not BuzzFeed.) Also, for whatever reason, people gravitate to more negative-sounding titles, like <a href="http://101books.net/?s=horrible+death" target="_blank">“7 Words That Should Die A Horrible Death.”</a></p>\n<h3>There are many blogs about books on the web. Why do you think yours has been so successful?</h3>\n<blockquote><p>I think people can easily get behind the idea of someone pursuing a crazy goal and the ups and downs that come with that.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There’s a lot of great book blogs out there, and a lot of bloggers who write incredibly detailed book reviews. My blog is a little different because I review books in small chunks; I take a small passage from a book and write about it. Or I write about some cool, unusual fact from the author’s background. So I think it stands out a bit in the book blogging world.</p>\n<p>Plus, I think people can easily get behind the idea of someone pursuing a crazy goal and the ups and downs that come with that. It’s like a literary version of the <em>Julie and Julia</em> book (and movie). Not that I’m near as creative and successful as she was, but you get the point.</p>\n<h3>Do you have tips for someone who wants to focus their blog on books?</h3>\n<blockquote><p>Sometimes you’ve just got to push the publish button because an almost-perfect blog post is better than no post at all.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Be honest. Don’t feel like you have to like a book or dislike a book because of what the critics say. On my blog, I’m very vocal of my dislike for <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em>, but it’s my honest opinion.</p>\n<p>If you want to write a book blog with an academic voice, that’s great. But you’ll probably realize that not many people will read it. I try to write about literature in an approachable way, and that style involves <em>forgetting</em> what my English literature professor taught me.</p>\n<p>I think it’s also important to <a href="http://101books.net/2013/04/19/3-tips-for-a-better-blog/" target="_blank">forget about being perfect</a>. Sometimes you’ve just got to push the publish button because an almost-perfect blog post is better than no post at all. Don’t pass over the great in search of the perfect.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/pingomatic.wordpress.com/107/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/pingomatic.wordpress.com/107/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=blog.pingomatic.com&blog=68432&post=107&subd=pingomatic&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 12 Jun 2014 16:00:25 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"Cheri Lucas Rowlands";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:106:"WPTavern: Clef Partners With Softaculous To Provide 2-Step Authentication For Automated WordPress Installs";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=24533";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:256:"http://wptavern.com/clef-partners-with-softaculous-to-provide-2-step-authentication-for-automated-wordpress-installs?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=clef-partners-with-softaculous-to-provide-2-step-authentication-for-automated-wordpress-installs";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3697:"<p><a title="https://getclef.com/" href="https://getclef.com/">Clef</a>, the two-step authentication service that replaces usernames and passwords <a title="http://blog.getclef.com/two-steps-foward/" href="http://blog.getclef.com/two-steps-foward/">has announced</a> a strategic partnership with <a title="http://www.softaculous.com/" href="http://www.softaculous.com/">Softaculous</a>.

He replied,</p>\n<blockquote><p>The future of WordPress security is about protecting every site, not just the big ones — including Clef in Softaculous WordPress installs will help establish a stronger baseline of security for everyone. Good security is something you should opt out of and hosts should be giving users better access to the security tools they need</p></blockquote>\n<p>Clef has experienced rapid growth since their launch.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Clef plugin is being downloaded more times each day than any other two-factor plugin is in a week</li>\n<li>Clef is being used by hedge funds to protect almost $2B in managed wealth</li>\n<li>Clef has doubled in size every six weeks since the beginning of the year</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When asked whether they tried to work with Fantastico as well as Softaculous, Byrne replied, &#8220;We&#8217;ve been working with Softaculous for a while to make this happen &#8212; they really love the product and it&#8217;s just been a matter of timing and development resources. We haven&#8217;t talked to any of the other installers, but we&#8217;ll definitely be looking to work with more of them soon.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With this partnership, thousands if not millions of WordPress auto installs will be safer immediately after installation. It also gives Clef an opportunity to vastly improve their reach into the WordPress ecosystem. Do you think this move will help make the web a safer place by improving the baseline of security for automated WordPress installations?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 12 Jun 2014 15:10:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"Matt: Extended Interview with Forbes";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=43838";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:52:"http://ma.tt/2014/06/extended-interview-with-forbes/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:915:"<p>J.

As an active member of the <a href="http://wptavern.com/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-wordpress-theme-reviewer" target="_blank">WordPress.org Theme Review Team</a>, Uzelac has a solid understanding of best practices and the passion to revive PressWork.</p>\n<p>I spoke with him to find out the details of the PressWork sale, only to discover that the founders actually gave him the project, branding and all, without no strings attached.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A couple of weeks ago I got in touch with c.bavota and asked if they have any future plans with the PressWork and if I could &#8216;take over,&#8217;&#8221; Uzelac told the Tavern. &#8220;The next day I received an e-mail along with c.bavota’s &#8216;Yes, you can.&#8217;&#8221; The PressWork GitHub repo has now been transferred to Uzelac&#8217;s account. The original PressWork team seemed eager to offload the project to someone who would give it a good home. &#8220;I&#8217;m not really sure if the guys had any interest in it anymore,&#8221; Uzelac said. <strong>&#8220;I simply asked for it.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever been given a non-working car, then you have a good foundation for understanding this transaction. PressWork received next to no contributions after the project was abandoned. Essentially, the framework needs a few updates to make it compatible with the latest version of WordPress, but there&#8217;s huge potential there if Uzelac can bring the project back up to speed.</p>\n<p>The fatal error of the original PressWork team was that they had no commercial backbone to sustain the framework&#8217;s continual development. Uzelac confirmed that he plans to relaunch with commercial products. <strong>&#8220;If I learned anything from developing the Responsive Theme, it&#8217;s that you have to add commercial products in the order to survive,&#8221;</strong> he said.</p>\n<p>Uzelac is in the process of updating the framework. &#8220;My main plan is to get the PressWork back in WordPress directory,&#8221; he said. &#8220;After that, a new modern look will be in order.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Before the original PressWork team closed the doors, they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130112204202/http://presswork.me/" target="_blank">reported</a> that tens of thousands of WordPress users had downloaded the theme. The framework now has a chance at a strong future. Instead of disappearing into the black hole of abandoned WordPress projects, <a href="http://presswork.io/" target="_blank">PressWork</a> has been adopted by a developer who is passionate about restoring its usefulness. What do you think Uzelac can do with it?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 12 Jun 2014 05:48:54 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:91:"WPTavern: New Data Shows WordPress Support Forum Registrations Surged Between 2009 and 2012";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=24511";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:226:"http://wptavern.com/new-data-shows-wordpress-support-forum-registrations-surged-between-2009-and-2012?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=new-data-shows-wordpress-support-forum-registrations-surged-between-2009-and-2012";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3430:"<p>A few days ago, Siobhan McKeown published a graphic <a title="https://twitter.com/SiobhanPMcKeown/status/475424535534379010" href="https://twitter.com/SiobhanPMcKeown/status/475424535534379010">on Twitter</a> that shows sign ups to the WordPress.org support forums between 2005 and 2014.

WordPress 3.0 <a title="http://wordpress.org/news/2010/06/thelonious/" href="http://wordpress.org/news/2010/06/thelonious/">was released</a> on June 17, 2010 and was a blockbuster release. For the first time, WordPress Multisite was part of the same package as WordPress.</p>\n<p>As McKeown explains, a spike in signups could reflect a number of things:</p>\n<blockquote><p>a) that a release has generated a spike in users , and/or b) that something in a new WordPress release is complex enough to require additional help in the support forums.</p>\n<p>There could be other environmental factors that cause new signups &#8211; for example, the month that Movable Type changed its license (and WordPress 1.2 came out with the new plugin architecture) signups more than doubled and stayed higher in the subsequent months.</p></blockquote>\n<p>When asked what other plans she has in store for the data, McKeown plans on looking at monthly signups in relation to WordPress releases and will plot graphs that visually display the relation between WordPress releases to forum signups.</p>\n<h3>No Meaningful Results</h3>\n<p>The data is not publicly available due to privacy concerns and was obtained by McKeown through Samuel Wood by request for the <a title="https://github.com/wordpress/book" href="https://github.com/wordpress/book">WordPress history book</a> she is writing.</p>\n<p>According to Wood, when compiling the data, he did not attempt to account for spam accounts. In 2012, a CAPTCHA was added to the user registration area of the support forums but it was only partially successful at combating the problem. &#8220;Because of this, I don&#8217;t think any meaningful conclusions can be drawn from those numbers. They are interesting and show interesting trends, but not any meaningful results to base any actions off of.&#8221; Wood said.</p>\n<h3>What Data Points Would You Like To See?</h3>\n<p>Regardless of whether or not the data is scientifically accurate, I still find the numbers interesting. However, without being able to review the data in months instead of years, it will be hard to come up with any specific correlations. I think it would be neat to see an average of how long a new user is active on the forums and whether that average has increased or decreased over time.</p>\n<p>What ideas or trends can you gleam from the data?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 12 Jun 2014 03:01:45 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"WPTavern: Michael Oeser of DER PRiNZ Acquires WordPress Theme Company ThemeShift";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=24471";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:204:"http://wptavern.com/michael-oeser-of-der-prinz-acquires-wordpress-theme-company-themeshift?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=michael-oeser-of-der-prinz-acquires-wordpress-theme-company-themeshift";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3219:"<p>In what has become a trend of late, another WordPress commercial theme shop has exchanged hands.

This is a relatively new trend that has caught on among companies that sell WordPress products and/or services. Last November, 10up <a href="http://wptavern.com/10up-sponsors-helen-hou-sandi-to-work-full-time-on-wordpress-core" target="_blank">announced</a> that it would be sponsoring Helen Hou-Sandi to work full-time on WordPress core. Many other WordPress-related companies and agencies regularly sponsor a portion of their employees time to contribute to WordPress, WordCamps and other open source projects.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://hire.jobvite.com/Jobvite/Job.aspx?m=nu65snwZ&o=34&j=oraPYfw8" target="_blank">WP Engine job advertisement</a> says that the developers selected will be responsible for submitting new functionality to the WordPress code base, making it more accessible and easy to use, keeping up with modern trends, and evangelizing the benefits of WordPress to the Austin, TX community and abroad. Tomas Puig, Head of marketing at WP Engine, said that they haven&#8217;t been getting enough of the right applicants so far, even though the jobs have been open since mid-April.</p>\n<p>Puig confirmed that the contributors WP Engine aims to hire will be 100% devoted to core and will occasionally interface with other open source projects such as NGINX. Applicants are not rigidly required to have contributed to core previously, but it certainly helps.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Our goal is to have people who have contributed to core in the past and this enables them to realize their dream about it becoming a full time job,&#8221;</strong> Puig said. &#8220;Though if an amazing developer that hasn&#8217;t contributed applies we&#8217;d like them to talk with Nacin and see if there is a fit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Puig said most of the current applicants have submitted patches to core, or plugins to the official directory. WP Engine has been speaking with WordPress lead developer Andrew Nacin to find recommendations for qualified applicants. The final hiring selection, however, will be done by WP Engine.</p>\n<p>What is WP Engine looking for, specifically? <strong>&#8220;Our first priorities is making sure they get along with the community and are fantastic engineers,&#8221;</strong> Puig said. &#8220;I&#8217;m really hopeful a known developer with commit access comes forward to apply.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WP Engine is hoping to relocate the selected developers to Austin, TX. &#8220;They do not have to relocate but our preference is that they are Austin or SF,&#8221; Puig said, as the employees would need to be on hand to fly in for company wide meetings.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not easy to find solid core contributors, much less ones willing to relocate. WordPress talent is in high demand and most of the developers of that caliber could work virtually anywhere. However, Puig is hopeful that they will find the right fit for giving back to the project.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If we&#8217;re going to fund full time positions we want them to be huge assets to the project. But in all honesty finding great developers for any company or project is hard.

His team was excited to give something back to the WordPress world, hence the release of Editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With the recent launch of Array, we thought it was a good opportunity to give back to the community on a larger scale and create a theme that would empower people to publish beautiful content with minimal effort,&#8221; McAlister said. His approach to releasing a free theme is rather unique in that it&#8217;s not a &#8220;lite version&#8221; of a better, commercial copy:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Although Editor is free, it is by no means limited or any less capable than a commercial theme. We put the same attention to detail into Editor as we do all of the themes in the Array collection. It was important to us that we create a theme that didn’t feel free or have any catch. No up-selling, no upgrade nags, no funny business. Just a unique and well-crafted theme that’s super easy to use from the second you activate it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is Array&#8217;s first theme on WordPress.org and if the experiment goes well, the team hopes to release another. McAlister said that they&#8217;ll be submitting Editor to WordPress.com in the coming days, so if you&#8217;re hosted there you may be able to use it soon.</p>\n<p>Right now, it&#8217;s only available for self-hosted WordPress blogs.

<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">cc</a></p></div>\n<p>Earlier this year Copyblogger set the blogosphere ablaze with its controversial <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/removing-blog-comments/" target="_blank">decision to turn off comments</a>. The announcement cited the burden of moderation, spam, and the availability of other conversation &#8220;outposts&#8221; as the main reasons for closing comments. It also gave the impression that Copyblogger had in many ways outgrown comments:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Blog comments are an amazing resource for any blog when it’s getting started. It’s a super convenient way to take the pulse of your audience&#8230;. And for eight years, comments have been a fantastic thing here on Copyblogger.</p>\n<p>We’re fortunate enough (mainly because Copyblogger’s been around for so long now) that we have a lot of thriving “outposts” where conversation happens.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Copyblogger isn&#8217;t the only site to turn the lights off on commenters. Popular Science, powered by Drupal, <a href="http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-09/why-were-shutting-our-comments">shut off comments</a> in September 2013, citing trolls, spambots, and a &#8220;fractious minority&#8221; detracting from its ability to foster intelligent conversation and debate. The editors felt that commenters often cast aspersion on the the validity of the science presented, prefacing the announcment with: <strong>&#8220;Comments can be bad for science. That&#8217;s why, here at PopularScience.com, we&#8217;re shutting them off.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<h3>The Rising Trend of Turning Comments Off</h3>\n<p>Copyblogger is likely the most influential WordPress site to adopt a comments-off approach to blogging, and <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/comments-off/" target="_blank">many</a> <a href="http://govcon.net/why-we-turned-off-comments-on-the-usa-gov-blog/" target="_blank">other</a> <a href="http://www.twistimage.com/blog/archives/shutting-down-blog-comments/" target="_blank">sites</a> have followed suit.</p>\n<p>The other day I noticed an influx of comment-killing plugins coming into the WordPress Plugin Directory. <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-no-comments/" target="_blank">Simple No Comments</a> is a plugin that turns them off upon activation. <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-disable-comments/" target="_blank">WP Disable Comments</a> entered the directory right around the same time with more fine-grained control for disabling comments globally or for specific post types, categories, tags, referrers, etc. <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/hear-no-evil/" target="_blank">Hear No Evil</a> is a relatively new one that blocks comments for a WordPress site or on a site-by-site basis in a multisite network.</p>\n<p>WordPress users are constantly on the hunt for better tools to help manage commenting and mitigate the unrelenting onslaught of spam. Publications turn comments off for different reasons, but it&#8217;s rarely due to the fact that they do not appreciate the comments left by genuine community members. Oftentimes the burden of spam moderation becomes greater than the benefit of conversation on posts.</p>\n<p>Comment moderation was introduced in <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2004/01/wordpress-10/">WordPress 1.0</a> in 2004 but at that time spammers were operating at a fraction of their current strength. Akismet <a href="http://blog.akismet.com/2014/06/01/may-stats-roundup/" target="_blank">reports</a> that the amount of spam it caught in May 2014 is up 4% from April, and up 269% from May 2012. This burden increases every year and even with powerful spam-blocking plugins in place, many will slip through the cracks.</p>\n<p>The solution for sites where interaction isn&#8217;t critical? Turn the comments off. Unfortunately, many sites do not have this luxury.</p>\n<h3>Removing Comments Suffocates Conversation</h3>\n<p>Traditionally, a blog post has been an invitation to a conversation. The weblog medium soared to popularity because of its interactive nature, which allowed readers to leave comments. Some might <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog#cite_note-2" target="_blank">contend</a> that this singular feature distinguishes the medium from other informational, static websites.</p>\n<p>Conversation and community are the natural byproducts of allowing open comments. They aren&#8217;t a utility to propel your blog to a state of maturity where you finally shed comments in a burst of enlightenment. They have intrinsic value. <span class="pullquote alignleft">Open comments are the affirmation that your blog is a conversation and not a soapbox.</span> Ultimately, allowing comments on your posts is about valuing conversation. Encouraging interaction on other social channels, while turning it off at home on your blog, sends a mixed message.</p>\n<p>When Copyblogger turned off comments, it encouraged readers to take the conversation to social networks and to write responses on their own blogs as an alternative to commenting on Copyblogger.com. How can you ask your readers to promote you on social networks and link to you from their blogs, when they&#8217;re not welcome at your home on the web? This is a conversation killer for those who have no motivation to write their own response posts or participate on social networks.</p>\n<h3>Removing Comments Fragments the Conversation</h3>\n<div id="attachment_24462" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/shattered.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[24451]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/shattered.jpg?resize=1024%2C564" alt="photo credit: Nils Geylen - cc" class="size-full wp-image-24462" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/napfisk/389135782/">Nils Geylen</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">cc</a></p></div>\n<p>Allowing social media to be the primary outposts for conversation on your content may bring some decent interaction for a short time, but posts sent via these channels soon disappear under the heavy stream of cat pictures, location checkins, Candy Crush invitations and every form of distraction.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, a conversation happening in many different places becomes severely fragmented, diluted, and difficult to track. The quality of the conversation starts to plummet. However, with comments open on your website, you have the opportunity for the brightest minds to respond to each other in one public location, not limited to x number of characters or the commenter&#8217;s social connections.</p>\n<p>If your blog is your home on the web, then everything important that you have to say should be said in your posts and in their comments. <span class="pullquote alignleft">Social networks come and go but your blog is forever.</span> If all the resulting conversations of your content are happening on social networks, what will you do when those data silos move on and all that content is lost?</p>\n<p>Sonia Simone, co-founder of Copyblogger Media, <a href="http://www.top5seo.co.uk/copyblogger-comments/#comment-5726" target="_blank">commented</a> on a blog responding to their announcement about removing comments, indicating that she isn&#8217;t concerned if the exchange of ideas is ultimately lost on social networks:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Basically, philosophically, I think it comes down to the fact that I don’t feel a need to own or preserve my conversations. What endures about a conversation is how I grow and learn from it — and that can’t be taken away.</p>\n<p>If twitter or Facebook or G+ gets taken out by a meteor tomorrow and I lose those conversations, that’s all right with me — because the important part is how the conversations have changed me.</p></blockquote>\n<p>What about the millions of others who could learn from or be changed by reading those conversations? Those who read a post months or years after its publish date will probably miss the corresponding social network post and will not have the opportunity to interact with others who have expertise and related knowledge to share on the topic.</p>\n<p>At times it can be disheartening for writers to see an empty comments section on an influential post with a wildly active conversation that moves straight to Twitter. Writers are then forced to chase the conversation in multiple places on the web and must be willing to follow wherever it goes. Many valuable responses are lost in social network posts that quickly evaporate and aren&#8217;t easy to search.</p>\n<p>Blog comments, however, are an enduring home for conversations, many of which result in the exchange of knowledge and ideas. Providing a home for conversations is unfortunately accompanied by the great burden of combating spam and moderating comments. Don&#8217;t give up, though. Our anti-spam tools continue to get better and someday you&#8217;ll be glad that you fought through all the bots to keep real communication alive in your comments. These conversations are the true gold of the internet.</p>\n<h3>Open Comments Are for Those Who Know They Haven&#8217;t Arrived</h3>\n<p>In years of working with WordPress, I&#8217;ve probably learned just as much from blog comments as I have from reading an author&#8217;s original post. At the Tavern, we&#8217;re strong advocates of commenting, because it&#8217;s often there that you&#8217;ll find the rest of the story unfolds. Multiple perspectives combine to form the big picture and the full story emerges when you have the community engaged.</p>\n<p>In online journalism, comments present a huge advantage over the traditional paper newspaper. They enable any citizen to correct misinformation and offer expertise that the author may be missing. You can&#8217;t know everything and you can&#8217;t see every side of a story. The comments section gives the story an opportunity to have a life of its own.</p>\n<p>Many users have expressed <a href="http://www.poststat.us/wordpress-comments/" target="_blank">dissatisfaction with WordPress&#8217; native comment system</a>, and third party systems like <a href="http://wptavern.com/the-idea-of-sponsored-comments-disqusts-me" target="_blank">Disqus</a> don&#8217;t enjoy a much better reputation. These are all part of the growing pains of comments evolving on the web, but don&#8217;t let their drawbacks drive you to close comments completely.</p>\n<p>Leaving comments open on blogs is an adventure. Sure, you may have to deal with spam, vitriol, and people who wrongly assume your blog&#8217;s comments are a support forum. But for the breakthrough gems of real communication and exchange, we leave comments open. It&#8217;s the readers who make a blog worthwhile. You can never outgrow conversation with them, no matter how big your brand or blog becomes.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 11 Jun 2014 03:53:19 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"WPTavern: DMCA Takedown Notice Issued Against Fork Of WP Migrate DB Pro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=24426";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:186:"http://wptavern.com/dmca-takedown-notice-issued-against-fork-of-wp-migrate-db-pro?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dmca-takedown-notice-issued-against-fork-of-wp-migrate-db-pro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3470:"<p><a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-migrate-db/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-migrate-db/">WP DB Migrate</a> by Brad Touesnard is a great plugin that makes it easy to migrate databases from one WordPress site to another.

Although several commercial themes and plugins are licensed under the GPL, it doesn&#8217;t mean you can violate a company&#8217;s trademark or infringe on their copyrights. If you&#8217;re going to fork a commercial WordPress product and redistribute it, here are a few tips to avoid trouble.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rename it. Keeping the same product name confuses users</li>\n<li>Maintain the copyright of the original author</li>\n<li>Do not use trademarked images, logos, etc.</li>\n<li>Create your own set of documentation and support system</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before forking, try working with the developer to have your features or fixes integrated into the product. Most of the time, they&#8217;ll gladly work with you to have a specific feature added, especially if there&#8217;s already a patch. If your WordPress products are GPL licensed, I&#8217;d like to know how you&#8217;ve handled trademark and copyright infringement in the comments.

Zapier is a collection of over 250 web apps that allow you to connect applications to automate tasks. Between WP Remote&#8217;s API and Zapier, the company hopes to give users the power to enhance their work day with more automation. The plan includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Free (does not require a paid plan)</li>\n<li>20 Triggers to choose from</li>\n<li>Your sites will refresh while you’re not logged in</li>\n<li><a href="http://zpr.io/ggKy">Zapier</a> will automatically push changes to your connected apps as they come in (15-30 minute delay)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When I asked Noel Tock, Partner and Head of Products for WP Remote, why they allowed Zapier to be free and what distinct advantages does hooking up with the service give the company, he replied:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Just as WP Remote was born out of something we had initially built for ourselves, we wanted to extend some of our newer efficiencies (as a WordPress agency and product company) to our WP Remote end users.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, connecting WP Remote and Zapier isn’t a ground breaking feature, but simply a smarter way for your tools to talk to one another. Unless we’re shipping unique or innovative enhancements (or features that have internal expenses associated such as backups), we’re quite happy to spread the love. As developers, freelancers or web designers, we simply use so many tools today that giving web applications the ability to communicate should be the norm, and not a paid upgrade.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Connecting sites to Zapier provides an assortment of opportunities to monitor and log events. For example, you can connect a WP Remote site to Pushover in Zapier and trigger it to send you push notifications on specific items such as failed backups or when new updates are available. Or, you could create an audit log by connecting a site to a Google Docs spreadsheet.</p>\n<div id="attachment_23819" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WPRemoteZapierAuditing.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23805]"><img class="size-full wp-image-23819" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WPRemoteZapierAuditing.jpg?resize=1025%2C720" alt="Creating Audit Logs With WPRemote and Zapier" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Creating Audit Logs With WPRemote and Zapier</p></div>\n<p>Tock said the company wants to see what types of creative Zaps are created by users, &#8220;we’ve shipped this integration with 20 different triggers specifically so we could see what creative ways people come up with to use it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WP Remote is not the first WordPress company to take advantage of Zapier.

Single theme purchases are now back in the mix.</p>\n<p><a href="https://press75.com/view/theme/so-simple/" target="_blank">So Simple</a> was one of the themes in Press75&#8242;s smaller subscription package, but after new management revised the pricing structure, they decided to offer it for free.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/so-simple.png" rel="prettyphoto[24363]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/so-simple.png?resize=852%2C486" alt="so-simple" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-24402" /></a></p>\n<p>As you can see, this super minimalist theme is almost entirely free of post meta, displaying only the published date. So Simple allows you to select a page to assign for the intro area within the WordPress customizer. This unique intro area disappears when the visitor clicks on the circular indicator attached to the right side of the viewport.  Check out the <a href="http://www.press75.com/themes/so-simple/" target="_blank">live demo</a> to see how it works.</p>\n<p>The theme adds options to the post edit screen which allow you to set a light or dark text color, or a custom permalink. The featured image you assign serves as a responsive fullscreen background image for the post in both the archive and single post views.</p>\n<p>So Simple is probably most notable for what it removes, rather than what it adds. It has no menu, no header and no widget areas, so these areas are not visible in the admin when the theme is active.</p>\n<p>The post writing experience is simplified as well, with tags and categories removed from the editing screen. (Please note that the admin tweaks can be disabled via the customizer.) The idea in using So Simple is to provide a distraction-free writing and reading experience.</p>\n<p>This theme is a natural choice for Press75 to make into a free product, as it doesn&#8217;t promise much but caters to a specific type of website owner. If bare bones minimalism is your style and you don&#8217;t mind a severely pruned post editing screen, check out So Simple. You can <a href="https://press75.com/view/theme/so-simple/" target="_blank">download it</a> for free from the Press75.com website.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 09 Jun 2014 21:35:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:112:"WPTavern: WordPress Multi-Environment Config: Work Seamlessly Between Development, Staging, and Production Sites";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=24365";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:262:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-multi-environment-config-work-seamlessly-between-development-staging-and-production-sites?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-multi-environment-config-work-seamlessly-between-development-staging-and-production-sites";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5783:"<div id="attachment_24392" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/control-panel.png" rel="prettyphoto[24365]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/control-panel.png?resize=1024%2C487" alt="photo credit: Matteo Bagnoli - cc" class="size-full wp-image-24392" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/matteo_bagnoli/5030486811/">Matteo Bagnoli</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">cc</a></p></div>\n<p>WordPress doesn&#8217;t have built-in support for developers working in multiple environments, i.e. local, staging, and production. It&#8217;s no surprise, given that this workflow isn&#8217;t part of the vast majority of users&#8217; lives when publishing with WordPress.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, running a separate development site can be a <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Running_a_Development_Copy_of_WordPress" target="_blank">complex and tedious endeavor</a> and WordPress doesn&#8217;t make it very easy. The process usually involves updating the database settings in wp-config.php and running a SQL change on the database to update the &#8216;wp_siteurl&#8217; and &#8216;wp_home&#8217; settings. Developers have different tools to help streamline the task of moving between different environments, but it&#8217;s still a pain.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Multi-Environment Config</h3>\n<p><a href="http://twitter.com/simonrjones" target="_blank">Simon Jones</a> is the founder and technical director of <a href="http://www.studio24.net/" target="_blank">Studio 24</a>, a web development agency that works extensively with WordPress. He believes that the platform should have better support for those working in multiple environments and has created an extension to the WP config system to elegantly support this.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In order to efficiently work on a project I prefer to have all the setup for different environments in the website code,&#8221; Jones said. <strong>&#8220;So when we push changes to staging things just work.&#8221;</strong> To that end, he created the <a href="https://github.com/studio24/wordpress-multi-env-config" target="_blank">WordPress Multi-Environment Config</a> project. It supports using WordPress in local development, staging, and production environments without having to edit your config files or update the site URLS in your database.</p>\n<p>Jones used an approach based on FocusLab’s work on the <a href="https://github.com/focuslabllc/ee-master-config" target="_blank">ExpressionEngine master config</a>. It splits the config files out into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>wp-config.default.php</strong> &#8211; any shared settings used across all environments</li>\n<li><strong>wp-config.{environment}.php</strong> &#8211; the settings for a specific environment</li>\n<li><strong>wp-config.env.php</strong> &#8211; sets up which URLs work for which environments</li>\n<li><strong>wp-config.php</strong> &#8211; the original WP config file which now contains loading code</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The way it works is that you copy any shared settings, i.e. auth keys and salts, into wp-config.default.php. You then copy your unique settings for each environment, i.e. database access details, to the wp-config{environment}.php file. In the wp-config.env.php file you then specify which URLs are defined for which environment. You can also set the environment via a webserver environment variable if you like.</p>\n<p>Once all of this is in place, WordPress will load the default config settings first, followed by the correct environment config based on either the settings in wp-config.env.php or the webserver environment variable. Your configuration then works seamlessly across your local, staging, and production URLs.</p>\n<p>Jones&#8217; experience with agency work inspired him to create the WordPress multi-environment config project. &#8220;Like many web developers and digital agencies, at Studio 24 we work on multiple environments for client websites,&#8221; he said. &#8220;<span class="pullquote alignleft">In my experience most CMSs don’t have great support for multiple environments</span>, it’s usually a case of local config files or changes to the database when files are pushed live. Even Drupal is only just starting to look at <a href="http://drupalwatchdog.com/2/2/drupal-8-preview" target="_blank">adding support for multiple environments in Drupal 8</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jones believes that WordPress needs multiple environment support in core. <strong>&#8220;Very few CMSs really consider this and it’s an essential feature for people working on the modern web,&#8221;</strong> he said. &#8220;With all the great improvements in WordPress over the past few years, features to help developers deploy and work on multiple environments would be great to see.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A better configuration management system would allow WordPress developers to be more efficient when working with enterprise environments, which often have more complex deployment workflows. Smaller agencies, individuals and anyone building WordPress sites may also benefit. Even if most WordPress users don&#8217;t work on their sites in multiple environments, there might be a way to make configuration management easier for those who do.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Jones&#8217; WordPress Multiple Environment Config provides a nice solution. Although it doesn&#8217;t handle migration of database data between environments, this setup offers a clean and convenient way to manage configuration when moving between sites.

(1, 1, '2014-06-16 16:07:20', '2014-06-16 16:07:20', 'Okay, so you\'ve done your market research (hopefully), put together an plan, cooked up your ground-breaking idea, and you are ready to build your website or app so you can get this show on the road. Also you know that you don\'t want to spend months or years learning how to code, so you\'ve decided to leverage the talents of a developer.\r\n\r\nYou can\'t quite afford the hot-shot developers at the agency downtown so you instinctually go to Craigslist or Elance and begin your search for the "right" freelance developer. You might even ask some friends for some contacts. You find someone who seems good enough and has a "great" rate. Hooray! You\'re good to go. You send the guy the deposit funds to start and the anticipation of the glorious outcome continues to build.\r\n<h3>The Aftermath</h3>\r\nSix months and thousands of dollars later, you still have no product to ship. Or if you do, the product is so buggy and expensive to maintain that your baby business is already fading fast. You\'re getting words like API, SQL, SSL, Gem, UX, SEO, Validation, Backend, Frontend, Analytics and CMS thrown at you. But you are totally in the dark about what\'s going on or what your contractor is actually doing. You\'re getting surprise invoices left and right for thousands of dollars. You have very few customers, if any, and the one\'s you do have are very unhappy. You\'re grand idea that was supposed to make you a fortune (or at least a living) is now an endless nightmare hobby that has sucked all the passion (and money) from you.\r\n\r\nYou now ask yourself, "Did I hire the right guy to do this?". It would seem like the catastrophe happened either because your idea was bad or because it was executed poorly by your developer. The self-centeredness in us all goes right to the developer as the scapegoat. "It\'s definitely their fault" (Even though the odds are your idea had some holes in it too). But the truth is, whether you blame your idea or your hired gun (or both), this all could\'ve been avoided by you. You already know this, but I\'ll say it anyway. You are ultimately responsible for the success of your product. That\'s the good and bad side of being in business. Sobering but true.\r\n<h3>Picking up the pieces</h3>\r\nThere\'s no way around it. Failing sucks. But what sucks more is failing and not being able to pin-point exactly why you failed. Or what to do next time to prevent failing the same way. Fact is, you could start over with a different developer and end up with the same result. FML. If insanity is doing the same thing over and over but expecting a different result, then you are riding the crazy train. In the end it feels more like a curse than a single unfortunate event. But it\'s time to take a stand.\r\n\r\nIs this you? Have you already been through a few developers on a few different projects with no success? Have developers and freelancers left a bad taste in your mouth? Never know what to expect? Always getting surprise bills for way more than you thought? Are you about to give up on your dream and write your ambitions off like everyone else?\r\n<h3>How it should be</h3>\r\nImagine it is simple to launch your product quickly and on budget. You are launching your app without a hitch, minimal bugs, and bringing joy to your customers. You are making a profit quickly, instead of waiting years to recoup your investment. You love working with your developer because she is an invaluable asset to your business. No "surprise invoices". She fills you in on exactly what is going on. Most of all, imagine it was easy to find her because you knew where to look, what signs to look for and how to hire her the right way. Is this world possible? Or is this person more like a unicorn?\r\n<h3>The secret</h3>\r\nWell, it turns out that hiring a great developer is not a pipe dream. The secret is that it takes a good coder to hire a good coder. In other words, pay an expensive "rockstar" coder to help you vet a developer for your project.\r\nThink about it. You don\'t know where to find quality developers. You don\'t know what good or bad code looks like. You don\'t know what traits and practices reveal a good developer or a bad one. You aren\'t sure which skills they need to have, i.e. design, frontend, backend, etc, etc. You don\'t know how to prove that they have the skills they say they do. Freelancers can just throw words and acronyms at you to impress you and get the sale (I\'ve seen it). You aren\'t even sure which platform to use, and hence what type of developer you\'ll need. There are so many unknowns in this situation, I can\'t even list them all. Why not leverage the brain of someone who understands this world. Even if it costs you a pretty penny to buy a couple session hours, it will be well worth it in the long run.\r\n\r\nFamous (or internet famous) developers are everywhere shipping products and living your dream. You can\'t justify hiring one of those guys at hundreds of dollars per hour for an entire project, but you could swing hiring them for one or two hours to help get you going in the right direction. Even if you pay a few hundred dollars for an hour of their time, this could save you thousands of dollars and potentially years of wasted time.\r\nWhere do you start?\r\n\r\nDo this. Find a "rockstar" developer on the web who you know without a doubt is an expert and developing things similar to your product. This is who you would hire to build your product if money was no object. But remember, you\'re just hiring her for 2 hours. Her hourly rate will be expensive. Email her and then try calling her up. Pay for an hour long session before you look for candidates to get an idea of who you want to find. Then pay her for another session again after you have at least 5 candidates and are ready to pull the trigger.\r\n\r\nI could (and should) write a whole book on this, but here is a quick run-down of what to do.\r\n<h4>1. Prepare: Get your stuff together</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Do market research online to make sure your idea is worth pursuing and there are people ready to buy your product</li>\r\n	<li>Make rough sketches of your product</li>\r\n	<li>Figure out the budget for your product</li>\r\n	<li>Figure out a rough timeline</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>2. First Session: Questions</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>What skills should my developer have to do this project?</li>\r\n	<li>What are the basic process needed for a project like this? (i.e. design &gt; frontend &gt; backend &gt; testing &gt; launch)</li>\r\n	<li>Which Platform/Language do you recommend for this project? i.e. Rails, Wordpress, Shopify, Magento, Objective C, Django, .NET, Java, etc. (You want to use the right platform for the project, not just whatever platform your developer happens to use)</li>\r\n	<li>For what reasons do you recommend this platform?</li>\r\n	<li>Where can I find good (insert platform) developers? Do you have a developer you would recommend?</li>\r\n	<li>Ask any questions about anything you don\'t understand. Ask as many questions as you can!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>3. Candidates: Find &amp; Interview</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Decide whether you want a remote developer or if you want to limit yourself to local</li>\r\n	<li>Find them online or from recommendation</li>\r\n	<li>Email them and request an estimate of cost &amp; time for your project. (Attach sketches)</li>\r\n	<li>Also ask to see their work (pay attention to their writing skills).</li>\r\n	<li>Call them. Ask them some questions that require an in depth response. (pay attention to their verbal communication skills)</li>\r\n	<li>Look at their GitHub.com account to see what "open source" projects they love to work on</li>\r\n	<li>Ask for references to call (I know this is old school but it works).</li>\r\n	<li>Ask references if they meet deadlines and budgets.</li>\r\n	<li>Years of experience don\'t matter</li>\r\n	<li>Don\'t be fooled by the hourly rate. It means nothing. Ask them a range of hours that it would take to complete project so you can get an idea of total cost.</li>\r\n	<li>Rule out anyone who is bad at communicating</li>\r\n	<li>Rule out anyone who is not excited to teach you about things you don\'t understand</li>\r\n	<li>Rule out anyone who you wouldn\'t enjoy interacting with a lot</li>\r\n	<li>Rule out anyone who is not passionate.</li>\r\n	<li>Narrow down to 3-5 developers</li>\r\n	<li>Meet them each in person for 30 minute interviews to get a feel for them</li>\r\n	<li>Compile all profiles, contact info, previous work, github urls, etc for each candidate, and email for your rockstar. (Make it easy to quickly move through their work and see what caliber of developer they are)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>4. Second Session: Questions</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>After viewing all candidates, which developer would be best for my project?</li>\r\n	<li>For what reasons is this developer the best choice?</li>\r\n	<li>Should I go along with _____\'s pricing and billing methods or propose a different payment structure?</li>\r\n	<li>My gut is telling me Bob, do you think he is a good pick?</li>\r\n	<li>Why or why wouldn\'t Bob be a good pick?</li>\r\n	<li>Ask every valuable question that comes to your mind.</li>\r\n	<li>It will be very clear at this point, and you will at least have it narrowed down to 1 or 2.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>5. Trial Run: Hire for pre-project</h4>\r\nNext hire the chosen developer for a mini-project. Regardless of who you pick, always do a pre-project if it\'s the first time working with someone. Take a small part of your large project and break it off into a mini-project that will have it\'s own budget and deadline. This is where the rubber meets the road and you can see if the developer is good to work with or not. Odds are if they\'ve been vetted by your rockstar it will be fine, but if not you can make your way down the list to the next best person.\r\n<h4>6. Make It Official: Hire to build your product</h4>\r\nNow that you\'ve completed the first pre-project and know that it\'s a good fit, it\'s time to dive in and get stuff done. You know that you can trust them. Your "rockstar" developer trusts them. Let\'s build this product! Sell it. Give customers what they are wanting and reap the benefits in the process.\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\nYou now have a great Ruby developer who is partnering with you on your product. She is keeping you in the know about everything and letting you know what to expect along the way. You know what her skills are and at least a little bit about everything they handle for you. You understand more than half of the acronyms now because she has been teaching you along the way. You know your using a Ruby On Rails backend platform with an API that talks to your iOS and Android app seamlessly. You also have a neutral third party who can help you decipher the state of your product when you get confused. You are able to focus on your customers now, the ones who really matter. This cohesiveness between you and your team helps your business become more profitable and helps you make better financial decisions.\r\n\r\nBut most of all, you have piece of mind because you know what is happening with your product and where you are taking this ship.', 'How to hire a developer', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'how-to-hire-a-developer', '', '', '2014-06-16 17:15:55', '2014-06-16 22:15:55', '', 0, 'http://devjournal.paradoxcreative.com/?p=1', 0, 'post', '', 0),

(24, 1, '2014-06-16 20:12:08', '2014-06-16 20:12:08', 'Okay, so you\'ve done your market research (hopefully), put together an plan, cooked up your ground-breaking idea, and you are ready to build your website or app so you can get this show on the road. Also you know that you don\'t want to spend months or years learning how to code, so you\'ve decided to leverage the talents of a developer.\n\nYou can\'t quite afford the hot-shot developers at the agency downtown so you instinctually go to Craigslist or Elance and begin your search for the "right" freelance developer. You might even ask some friends for some contacts. You find someone who seems good enough and has a "great" rate. Hooray! You\'re good to go. You send the guy the deposit funds to start and the anticipation of the glorious outcome continues to build.\n<h3>The Aftermath</h3>\nSix months and thousands of dollars later, you still have no product to ship. Or if you do, the product is so buggy and expensive to maintain that your baby business is already fading fast. You\'re getting words like API, SQL, SSL, Gem, UX, SEO, Validation, Backend, Frontend, Analytics and CMS thrown at you. But you are totally in the dark about what\'s going on or what your contractor is actually doing. You\'re getting surprise invoices left and right for thousands of dollars. You have very few customers, if any, and the one\'s you do have are very unhappy. You\'re grand idea that was supposed to make you a fortune (or at least a living) is now an endless nightmare hobby that has sucked all the passion (and money) from you.\n\nYou now ask yourself, "Did I hire the right guy to do this?". It would seem like the catastrophe happened either because your idea was bad or because it was executed poorly by your developer. The self-centeredness in us all goes right to the developer as the scapegoat. "It\'s definitely their fault" (Even though the odds are your idea had some holes in it too). But the truth is, whether you blame your idea or your hired gun (or both), this all could\'ve been avoided by you. You already know this, but I\'ll say it anyway. You are ultimately responsible for the success of your product. That\'s the good and bad side of being in business. Sobering but true.\n<h3>Picking up the pieces</h3>\nThere\'s no way around it. Failing sucks. But what sucks more is failing and not being able to pin-point exactly why you failed. Or what to do next time to prevent failing the same way. Fact is, you could start over with a different developer and end up with the same result. FML. If insanity is doing the same thing over and over but expecting a different result, then you are riding the crazy train. In the end it feels more like a curse than a single unfortunate event. But it\'s time to take a stand.\nIs this you? Have you already been through a few developers on a few different projects with no success? Have developers and freelancers left a bad taste in your mouth? Never know what to expect? Always getting surprise bills for way more than you thought? Are you about to give up on your dream and write your ambitions off like everyone else?\n<h3>How it should be</h3>\nImagine it is simple to launch your product quickly and on budget. You are launching your app without a hitch, minimal bugs, and bringing joy to your customers. You are making a profit quickly, instead of waiting years to recoup your investment. You love working with your developer because she is an invaluable asset to your business. No "surprise invoices". She fills you in on exactly what is going on. Most of all, imagine it was easy to find her because you knew where to look, what signs to look for and how to hire her the right way. Is this world possible? Or is this person more like a unicorn?\n<h3>The secret</h3>\nWell, it turns out that hiring a great developer is not a pipe dream. The secret is that it takes a good coder to hire a good coder. In other words, pay an expensive "rockstar" coder to help you vet a developer for your project.\nThink about it. You don\'t know where to find quality developers.

Take a small part of your large project and break it off into a mini-project that will have it\'s own budget and deadline. This is where the rubber meets the road and you can see if the developer is good to work with or not. Odds are if they\'ve been vetted by your rockstar it will be fine, but if not you can make your way down the list to the next best person.\n<h3>6. Make It Official: Hire to build your product</h3>\nNow that you\'ve completed the first pre-project and know that it\'s a good fit, it\'s time to dive in and get stuff done.

She is keeping you in the know about everything and letting you know what to expect along the way. You know what her skills are and at least a little bit about everything they handle for you. You understand more than half of the acronyms now because she has been teaching you along the way. You know your using a Ruby On Rails backend platform with an API that talks to your iOS and Android app seamlessly. You also have a neutral third party who can help you decipher the state of your product when you get confused. You are able to focus on your customers now, the ones who really matter. This cohesiveness between you and your team helps your business become more profitable and helps you make better financial decisions.\n\nBut most of all, you have piece of mind because you know what is happening with your product and where you are taking this ship moving forward.\n\nPlease subscribe below to receive more how-to\'s on bootstrapping, development &amp; design.', 'How to hire a developer', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '1-autosave-v1', '', '', '2014-06-16 20:12:08', '2014-06-16 20:12:08', '', 1, 'http://devjournal.paradoxcreative.com/1-autosave-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0) ;

Also you know that you don\'t want to spend months or years learning how to code, so you\'ve decided to leverage the talents of a developer.\r\n\r\nYou can\'t quite afford the hot-shot developers at the agency downtown so you instinctually go to Craigslist or Elance and begin your search for the "right" freelance developer. You might even ask some friends for some contacts. You find someone who seems good enough and has a "great" rate. Hooray! You\'re good to go. You send the guy the deposit funds to start and the anticipation of the glorious outcome continues to build.\r\n<h2>The Aftermath</h2>\r\nSix months and thousands of dollars later, you still have no product to ship. Or if you do, the product is so buggy and expensive to maintain that your baby business is already fading fast. You\'re getting words like API, SQL, SSL, Gem, UX, SEO, Validation, Backend, Frontend, Analytics and CMS thrown at you. But you are totally in the dark about what\'s going on or what your contractor is actually doing. You\'re getting surprise invoices left and right for thousands of dollars. You have very few customers, if any, and the one\'s you do have are very unhappy. You\'re grand idea that was supposed to make you a fortune (or at least a living) is now an endless nightmare hobby that has sucked all the passion (and money) from you.\r\n\r\nYou now ask yourself, "Did I hire the right guy to do this?". It would seem like the catastrophe happened either because your idea was bad or because it was executed poorly by your developer. The self-centeredness in us all goes right to the developer as the scapegoat. "It\'s definitely their fault" (Even though the odds are your idea had some holes in it too). But the truth is, whether you blame your idea or your hired gun (or both), this all could\'ve been avoided by you. You already know this, but I\'ll say it anyway. You are ultimately responsible for the success of your product. That\'s the good and bad side of being in business. Sobering but true.\r\n<h2>Picking up the pieces</h2>\r\nThere\'s no way around it. Failing sucks. But what sucks more is failing and not being able to pin-point exactly why you failed. Or what to do next time to prevent failing the same way. Fact is, you could start over with a different developer and end up with the same result. FML. If insanity is doing the same thing over and over but expecting a different result, then you are riding the crazy train. In the end it feels more like a curse than a single unfortunate event. But it\'s time to take a stand.\r\nIs this you? Have you already been through a few developers on a few different projects with no success? Have developers and freelancers left a bad taste in your mouth? Never know what to expect? Always getting surprise bills for way more than you thought? Are you about to give up on your dream and write your ambitions off like everyone else?\r\n<h2>How it should be</h2>\r\nImagine it is simple to launch your product quickly and on budget. You are launching your app without a hitch, minimal bugs, and bringing joy to your customers. You are making a profit quickly, instead of waiting years to recoup your investment. You love working with your developer because she is an invaluable asset to your business. No "surprise invoices". She fills you in on exactly what is going on. Most of all, imagine it was easy to find her because you knew where to look, what signs to look for and how to hire her the right way. Is this world possible? Or is this person more like a unicorn?\r\n<h2>The secret</h2>\r\nWell, it turns out that hiring a great developer is not a pipe dream. The secret is that it takes a good coder to hire a good coder. In other words, pay an expensive "rockstar" coder to help you vet a developer for your project.\r\nThink about it. You don\'t know where to find quality developers. You don\'t know what good or bad code looks like. You don\'t know what traits and practices reveal a good developer or a bad one. You aren\'t sure which skills they need to have, i.e. design, frontend, backend, etc, etc. You don\'t know how to prove that they have the skills they say they do. Freelancers can just throw words and acronyms at you to impress you and get the sale (I\'ve seen it). You aren\'t even sure which platform to use, and hence what type of developer you\'ll need. There are so many unknowns in this situation, I can\'t even list them all. Why not leverage the brain of someone who understands this world.

Even if you pay a few hundred dollars for an hour of their time, this could save you thousands of dollars and potentially years of wasted time.\r\nWhere do you start?\r\n\r\nDo this. Find a "rockstar" developer on the web who you know without a doubt is an expert and developing things similar to your product. This is who you would hire to build your product if money was no object. But remember, you\'re just hiring her for 2 hours. Her hourly rate will be expensive. Email her and then try calling her up. Pay for an hour long session before you look for candidates to get an idea of who you want to find. Then pay her for another session again after you have at least 5 candidates and are ready to pull the trigger.\r\n\r\nI could (and should) write a whole book on this, but here is a quick run-down of what to do.\r\n<h4>1. Prepare: Get your stuff together</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Do market research online to make sure your idea is worth pursuing and there are people ready to buy your product</li>\r\n	<li>Make rough sketches of your product</li>\r\n	<li>Figure out the budget for your product</li>\r\n	<li>Figure out a rough timeline</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>2. First Session: Questions</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>What skills should my developer have to do this project?</li>\r\n	<li>What are the basic process needed for a project like this? (i.e. design &gt; frontend &gt; backend &gt; testing &gt; launch)</li>\r\n	<li>Which Platform/Language do you recommend for this project? i.e. Rails, Wordpress, Shopify, Magento, Objective C, Django, .NET, Java, etc. (You want to use the right platform for the project, not just whatever platform your developer happens to use)</li>\r\n	<li>For what reasons do you recommend this platform?</li>\r\n	<li>Where can I find good (insert platform) developers? Do you have a developer you would recommend?</li>\r\n	<li>Ask any questions about anything you don\'t understand. Ask as many questions as you can!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>3. Candidates: Find &amp; Interview</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Decide whether you want a remote developer or if you want to limit yourself to local</li>\r\n	<li>Find them online or from recommendation</li>\r\n	<li>Email them and request an estimate of cost &amp; time for your project. (Attach sketches)</li>\r\n	<li>Also ask to see their work (pay attention to their writing skills).</li>\r\n	<li>Call them. Ask them some questions that require an in depth response. (pay attention to their verbal communication skills)</li>\r\n	<li>Look at their GitHub.com account to see what "open source" projects they love to work on</li>\r\n	<li>Ask for references to call (I know this is old school but it works).</li>\r\n	<li>Ask references if they meet deadlines and budgets.</li>\r\n	<li>Years of experience don\'t matter</li>\r\n	<li>Don\'t be fooled by the hourly rate. It means nothing. Ask them a range of hours that it would take to complete project so you can get an idea of total cost.</li>\r\n	<li>Rule out anyone who is bad at communicating</li>\r\n	<li>Rule out anyone who is not excited to teach you about things you don\'t understand</li>\r\n	<li>Rule out anyone who you wouldn\'t enjoy interacting with a lot</li>\r\n	<li>Rule out anyone who is not passionate.</li>\r\n	<li>Narrow down to 3-5 developers</li>\r\n	<li>Meet them each in person for 30 minute interviews to get a feel for them</li>\r\n	<li>Compile all profiles, contact info, previous work, github urls, etc for each candidate, and email for your rockstar. (Make it easy to quickly move through their work and see what caliber of developer they are)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>4. Second Session: Questions</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>After viewing all candidates, which developer would be best for my project?</li>\r\n	<li>For what reasons is this developer the best choice?</li>\r\n	<li>Should I go along with _____\'s pricing and billing methods or propose a different payment structure?</li>\r\n	<li>My gut is telling me Bob, do you think he is a good pick?</li>\r\n	<li>Why or why wouldn\'t Bob be a good pick?</li>\r\n	<li>Ask every valuable question that comes to your mind.</li>\r\n	<li>It will be very clear at this point, and you will at least have it narrowed down to 1 or 2.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>5. Trial Run: Hire for pre-project</h4>\r\nNext hire the chosen developer for a mini-project. Regardless of who you pick, always do a pre-project if it\'s the first time working with someone. Take a small part of your large project and break it off into a mini-project that will have it\'s own budget and deadline. This is where the rubber meets the road and you can see if the developer is good to work with or not. Odds are if they\'ve been vetted by your rockstar it will be fine, but if not you can make your way down the list to the next best person.\r\n<h4>6. Make It Official: Hire to build your product</h4>\r\nNow that you\'ve completed the first pre-project and know that it\'s a good fit, it\'s time to dive in and get stuff done. You know that you can trust them. Your "rockstar" developer trusts them. Let\'s build this product! Sell it. Give customers what they are wanting and reap the benefits in the process.\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\nYou now have a great Ruby developer who is partnering with you on your product. She is keeping you in the know about everything and letting you know what to expect along the way. You know what her skills are and at least a little bit about everything they handle for you.

Prepare: Get your stuff together</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Do market research online to make sure your idea is worth pursuing and there are people ready to buy your product</li>\r\n	<li>Make rough sketches of your product</li>\r\n	<li>Figure out the budget for your product</li>\r\n	<li>Figure out a rough timeline</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>2. First Session: Questions</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>What skills should my developer have to do this project?</li>\r\n	<li>What are the basic process needed for a project like this? (i.e. design &gt; frontend &gt; backend &gt; testing &gt; launch)</li>\r\n	<li>Which Platform/Language do you recommend for this project? i.e. Rails, Wordpress, Shopify, Magento, Objective C, Django, .NET, Java, etc. (You want to use the right platform for the project, not just whatever platform your developer happens to use)</li>\r\n	<li>For what reasons do you recommend this platform?</li>\r\n	<li>Where can I find good (insert platform) developers? Do you have a developer you would recommend?</li>\r\n	<li>Ask any questions about anything you don\'t understand. Ask as many questions as you can!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>3. Candidates: Find &amp; Interview</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Decide whether you want a remote developer or if you want to limit yourself to local</li>\r\n	<li>Find them online or from recommendation</li>\r\n	<li>Email them and request an estimate of cost &amp; time for your project. (Attach sketches)</li>\r\n	<li>Also ask to see their work (pay attention to their writing skills).</li>\r\n	<li>Call them. Ask them some questions that require an in depth response. (pay attention to their verbal communication skills)</li>\r\n	<li>Look at their GitHub.com account to see what "open source" projects they love to work on</li>\r\n	<li>Ask for references to call (I know this is old school but it works).</li>\r\n	<li>Ask references if they meet deadlines and budgets.</li>\r\n	<li>Years of experience don\'t matter</li>\r\n	<li>Don\'t be fooled by the hourly rate. It means nothing. Ask them a range of hours that it would take to complete project so you can get an idea of total cost.</li>\r\n	<li>Rule out anyone who is bad at communicating</li>\r\n	<li>Rule out anyone who is not excited to teach you about things you don\'t understand</li>\r\n	<li>Rule out anyone who you wouldn\'t enjoy interacting with a lot</li>\r\n	<li>Rule out anyone who is not passionate.</li>\r\n	<li>Narrow down to 3-5 developers</li>\r\n	<li>Meet them each in person for 30 minute interviews to get a feel for them</li>\r\n	<li>Compile all profiles, contact info, previous work, github urls, etc for each candidate, and email for your rockstar. (Make it easy to quickly move through their work and see what caliber of developer they are)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>4. Second Session: Questions</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>After viewing all candidates, which developer would be best for my project?</li>\r\n	<li>For what reasons is this developer the best choice?</li>\r\n	<li>Should I go along with _____\'s pricing and billing methods or propose a different payment structure?</li>\r\n	<li>My gut is telling me Bob, do you think he is a good pick?</li>\r\n	<li>Why or why wouldn\'t Bob be a good pick?</li>\r\n	<li>Ask every valuable question that comes to your mind.</li>\r\n	<li>It will be very clear at this point, and you will at least have it narrowed down to 1 or 2.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>5. Trial Run: Hire for pre-project</h4>\r\nNext hire the chosen developer for a mini-project. Regardless of who you pick, always do a pre-project if it\'s the first time working with someone. Take a small part of your large project and break it off into a mini-project that will have it\'s own budget and deadline. This is where the rubber meets the road and you can see if the developer is good to work with or not. Odds are if they\'ve been vetted by your rockstar it will be fine, but if not you can make your way down the list to the next best person.\r\n<h4>6. Make It Official: Hire to build your product</h4>\r\nNow that you\'ve completed the first pre-project and know that it\'s a good fit, it\'s time to dive in and get stuff done. You know that you can trust them. Your "rockstar" developer trusts them. Let\'s build this product! Sell it. Give customers what they are wanting and reap the benefits in the process.\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\nYou now have a great Ruby developer who is partnering with you on your product. She is keeping you in the know about everything and letting you know what to expect along the way. You know what her skills are and at least a little bit about everything they handle for you. You understand more than half of the acronyms now because she has been teaching you along the way. You know your using a Ruby On Rails backend platform with an API that talks to your iOS and Android app seamlessly. You also have a neutral third party who can help you decipher the state of your product when you get confused. You are able to focus on your customers now, the ones who really matter. This cohesiveness between you and your team helps your business become more profitable and helps you make better financial decisions.\r\n\r\nBut most of all, you have piece of mind because you know what is happening with your product and where you are taking this ship.', 'Project vs. Product', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'project-vs-product', '', '', '2014-06-17 13:52:02', '2014-06-17 18:52:02', '', 0, 'http://dev.theparadoxjournal.com/?p=29', 0, 'post', '', 0),

You might even ask some friends for some contacts. You find someone who seems good enough and has a "great" rate. Hooray! You\'re good to go. You send the guy the deposit funds to start and the anticipation of the glorious outcome continues to build.\r\n<h3>The Aftermath</h3>\r\nSix months and thousands of dollars later, you still have no product to ship. Or if you do, the product is so buggy and expensive to maintain that your baby business is already fading fast. You\'re getting words like API, SQL, SSL, Gem, UX, SEO, Validation, Backend, Frontend, Analytics and CMS thrown at you. But you are totally in the dark about what\'s going on or what your contractor is actually doing. You\'re getting surprise invoices left and right for thousands of dollars. You have very few customers, if any, and the one\'s you do have are very unhappy. You\'re grand idea that was supposed to make you a fortune (or at least a living) is now an endless nightmare hobby that has sucked all the passion (and money) from you.\r\n\r\nYou now ask yourself, "Did I hire the right guy to do this?". It would seem like the catastrophe happened either because your idea was bad or because it was executed poorly by your developer. The self-centeredness in us all goes right to the developer as the scapegoat. "It\'s definitely their fault" (Even though the odds are your idea had some holes in it too). But the truth is, whether you blame your idea or your hired gun (or both), this all could\'ve been avoided by you. You already know this, but I\'ll say it anyway. You are ultimately responsible for the success of your product. That\'s the good and bad side of being in business. Sobering but true.\r\n<h3>Picking up the pieces</h3>\r\nThere\'s no way around it. Failing sucks. But what sucks more is failing and not being able to pin-point exactly why you failed. Or what to do next time to prevent failing the same way. Fact is, you could start over with a different developer and end up with the same result. FML. If insanity is doing the same thing over and over but expecting a different result, then you are riding the crazy train. In the end it feels more like a curse than a single unfortunate event. But it\'s time to take a stand.\r\n\r\nIs this you? Have you already been through a few developers on a few different projects with no success? Have developers and freelancers left a bad taste in your mouth? Never know what to expect? Always getting surprise bills for way more than you thought? Are you about to give up on your dream and write your ambitions off like everyone else?\r\n<h3>How it should be</h3>\r\nImagine it is simple to launch your product quickly and on budget. You are launching your app without a hitch, minimal bugs, and bringing joy to your customers. You are making a profit quickly, instead of waiting years to recoup your investment. You love working with your developer because she is an invaluable asset to your business. No "surprise invoices". She fills you in on exactly what is going on. Most of all, imagine it was easy to find her because you knew where to look, what signs to look for and how to hire her the right way. Is this world possible? Or is this person more like a unicorn?\r\n<h3>The secret</h3>\r\nWell, it turns out that hiring a great developer is not a pipe dream. The secret is that it takes a good coder to hire a good coder. In other words, pay an expensive "rockstar" coder to help you vet a developer for your project.\r\nThink about it. You don\'t know where to find quality developers. You don\'t know what good or bad code looks like. You don\'t know what traits and practices reveal a good developer or a bad one. You aren\'t sure which skills they need to have, i.e. design, frontend, backend, etc, etc. You don\'t know how to prove that they have the skills they say they do. Freelancers can just throw words and acronyms at you to impress you and get the sale (I\'ve seen it). You aren\'t even sure which platform to use, and hence what type of developer you\'ll need. There are so many unknowns in this situation, I can\'t even list them all. Why not leverage the brain of someone who understands this world. Even if it costs you a pretty penny to buy a couple session hours, it will be well worth it in the long run.\r\n\r\nFamous (or internet famous) developers are everywhere shipping products and living your dream. You can\'t justify hiring one of those guys at hundreds of dollars per hour for an entire project, but you could swing hiring them for one or two hours to help get you going in the right direction. Even if you pay a few hundred dollars for an hour of their time, this could save you thousands of dollars and potentially years of wasted time.\r\nWhere do you start?\r\n\r\nDo this. Find a "rockstar" developer on the web who you know without a doubt is an expert and developing things similar to your product. This is who you would hire to build your product if money was no object. But remember, you\'re just hiring her for 2 hours. Her hourly rate will be expensive. Email her and then try calling her up.

But you are totally in the dark about what\'s going on or what your contractor is actually doing. You\'re getting surprise invoices left and right for thousands of dollars. You have very few customers, if any, and the one\'s you do have are very unhappy. You\'re grand idea that was supposed to make you a fortune (or at least a living) is now an endless nightmare hobby that has sucked all the passion (and money) from you.\r\n\r\nYou now ask yourself, "Did I hire the right guy to do this?". It would seem like the catastrophe happened either because your idea was bad or because it was executed poorly by your developer. The self-centeredness in us all goes right to the developer as the scapegoat. "It\'s definitely their fault" (Even though the odds are your idea had some holes in it too). But the truth is, whether you blame your idea or your hired gun (or both), this all could\'ve been avoided by you. You already know this, but I\'ll say it anyway. You are ultimately responsible for the success of your product. That\'s the good and bad side of being in business. Sobering but true.\r\n<h3>Picking up the pieces</h3>\r\nThere\'s no way around it. Failing sucks. But what sucks more is failing and not being able to pin-point exactly why you failed. Or what to do next time to prevent failing the same way. Fact is, you could start over with a different developer and end up with the same result. FML. If insanity is doing the same thing over and over but expecting a different result, then you are riding the crazy train. In the end it feels more like a curse than a single unfortunate event. But it\'s time to take a stand.\r\n\r\nIs this you? Have you already been through a few developers on a few different projects with no success? Have developers and freelancers left a bad taste in your mouth? Never know what to expect? Always getting surprise bills for way more than you thought? Are you about to give up on your dream and write your ambitions off like everyone else?\r\n<h3>How it should be</h3>\r\nImagine it is simple to launch your product quickly and on budget. You are launching your app without a hitch, minimal bugs, and bringing joy to your customers. You are making a profit quickly, instead of waiting years to recoup your investment. You love working with your developer because she is an invaluable asset to your business. No "surprise invoices". She fills you in on exactly what is going on. Most of all, imagine it was easy to find her because you knew where to look, what signs to look for and how to hire her the right way. Is this world possible? Or is this person more like a unicorn?\r\n<h3>The secret</h3>\r\nWell, it turns out that hiring a great developer is not a pipe dream. The secret is that it takes a good coder to hire a good coder. In other words, pay an expensive "rockstar" coder to help you vet a developer for your project.\r\nThink about it. You don\'t know where to find quality developers. You don\'t know what good or bad code looks like. You don\'t know what traits and practices reveal a good developer or a bad one. You aren\'t sure which skills they need to have, i.e. design, frontend, backend, etc, etc. You don\'t know how to prove that they have the skills they say they do. Freelancers can just throw words and acronyms at you to impress you and get the sale (I\'ve seen it). You aren\'t even sure which platform to use, and hence what type of developer you\'ll need. There are so many unknowns in this situation, I can\'t even list them all. Why not leverage the brain of someone who understands this world. Even if it costs you a pretty penny to buy a couple session hours, it will be well worth it in the long run.\r\n\r\nFamous (or internet famous) developers are everywhere shipping products and living your dream. You can\'t justify hiring one of those guys at hundreds of dollars per hour for an entire project, but you could swing hiring them for one or two hours to help get you going in the right direction. Even if you pay a few hundred dollars for an hour of their time, this could save you thousands of dollars and potentially years of wasted time.\r\nWhere do you start?\r\n\r\nDo this. Find a "rockstar" developer on the web who you know without a doubt is an expert and developing things similar to your product. This is who you would hire to build your product if money was no object. But remember, you\'re just hiring her for 2 hours. Her hourly rate will be expensive. Email her and then try calling her up. Pay for an hour long session before you look for candidates to get an idea of who you want to find. Then pay her for another session again after you have at least 5 candidates and are ready to pull the trigger.\r\n\r\nI could (and should) write a whole book on this, but here is a quick run-down of what to do.\r\n<h4>1. Prepare: Get your stuff together</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Do market research online to make sure your idea is worth pursuing and there are people ready to buy your product</li>\r\n	<li>Make rough sketches of your product</li>\r\n	<li>Figure out the budget for your product</li>\r\n	<li>Figure out a rough timeline</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>2. First Session: Questions</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>What skills should my developer have to do this project?</li>\r\n	<li>What are the basic process needed for a project like this? (i.e. design &gt; frontend &gt; backend &gt; testing &gt; launch)</li>\r\n	<li>Which Platform/Language do you recommend for this project? i.e. Rails, Wordpress, Shopify, Magento, Objective C, Django, .NET, Java, etc. (You want to use the right platform for the project, not just whatever platform your developer happens to use)</li>\r\n	<li>For what reasons do you recommend this platform?</li>\r\n	<li>Where can I find good (insert platform) developers? Do you have a developer you would recommend?</li>\r\n	<li>Ask any questions about anything you don\'t understand. Ask as many questions as you can!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>3. Candidates: Find &amp; Interview</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Decide whether you want a remote developer or if you want to limit yourself to local</li>\r\n	<li>Find them online or from recommendation</li>\r\n	<li>Email them and request an estimate of cost &amp; time for your project. (Attach sketches)</li>\r\n	<li>Also ask to see their work (pay attention to their writing skills).</li>\r\n	<li>Call them. Ask them some questions that require an in depth response. (pay attention to their verbal communication skills)</li>\r\n	<li>Look at their GitHub.com account to see what "open source" projects they love to work on</li>\r\n	<li>Ask for references to call (I know this is old school but it works).</li>\r\n	<li>Ask references if they meet deadlines and budgets.</li>\r\n	<li>Years of experience don\'t matter</li>\r\n	<li>Don\'t be fooled by the hourly rate. It means nothing. Ask them a range of hours that it would take to complete project so you can get an idea of total cost.</li>\r\n	<li>Rule out anyone who is bad at communicating</li>\r\n	<li>Rule out anyone who is not excited to teach you about things you don\'t understand</li>\r\n	<li>Rule out anyone who you wouldn\'t enjoy interacting with a lot</li>\r\n	<li>Rule out anyone who is not passionate.</li>\r\n	<li>Narrow down to 3-5 developers</li>\r\n	<li>Meet them each in person for 30 minute interviews to get a feel for them</li>\r\n	<li>Compile all profiles, contact info, previous work, github urls, etc for each candidate, and email for your rockstar. (Make it easy to quickly move through their work and see what caliber of developer they are)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>4. Second Session: Questions</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>After viewing all candidates, which developer would be best for my project?</li>\r\n	<li>For what reasons is this developer the best choice?</li>\r\n	<li>Should I go along with _____\'s pricing and billing methods or propose a different payment structure?</li>\r\n	<li>My gut is telling me Bob, do you think he is a good pick?</li>\r\n	<li>Why or why wouldn\'t Bob be a good pick?</li>\r\n	<li>Ask every valuable question that comes to your mind.</li>\r\n	<li>It will be very clear at this point, and you will at least have it narrowed down to 1 or 2.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>5. Trial Run: Hire for pre-project</h4>\r\nNext hire the chosen developer for a mini-project. Regardless of who you pick, always do a pre-project if it\'s the first time working with someone. Take a small part of your large project and break it off into a mini-project that will have it\'s own budget and deadline. This is where the rubber meets the road and you can see if the developer is good to work with or not. Odds are if they\'ve been vetted by your rockstar it will be fine, but if not you can make your way down the list to the next best person.\r\n<h4>6. Make It Official: Hire to build your product</h4>\r\nNow that you\'ve completed the first pre-project and know that it\'s a good fit, it\'s time to dive in and get stuff done. You know that you can trust them. Your "rockstar" developer trusts them. Let\'s build this product! Sell it. Give customers what they are wanting and reap the benefits in the process.\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\nYou now have a great Ruby developer who is partnering with you on your product. She is keeping you in the know about everything and letting you know what to expect along the way. You know what her skills are and at least a little bit about everything they handle for you. You understand more than half of the acronyms now because she has been teaching you along the way. You know your using a Ruby On Rails backend platform with an API that talks to your iOS and Android app seamlessly. You also have a neutral third party who can help you decipher the state of your product when you get confused. You are able to focus on your customers now, the ones who really matter. This cohesiveness between you and your team helps your business become more profitable and helps you make better financial decisions.\r\n\r\nBut most of all, you have piece of mind because you know what is happening with your product and where you are taking this ship.', 'Bootstrapping with Bootstrap', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '31-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-06-17 12:09:19', '2014-06-17 17:09:19', '', 31, 'http://dev.theparadoxjournal.com/31-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
