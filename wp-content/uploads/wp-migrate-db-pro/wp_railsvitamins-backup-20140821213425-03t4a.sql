Over the last few WordPress releases, we&#8217;ve made a number of improvements to features like autosaves and revisions. With revisions, an old edit can always be restored. We&#8217;re trying our hardest to save your content somewhere even if your power goes out or your browser crashes. We even monitor your internet connection and prevent you from hitting that &#8220;Publish&#8221; button at the exact moment the coffee shop Wi-Fi has a hiccup.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s <em>possible</em> that the quick draft you lost last week is still in the database, and just hidden from view. As an added complication, these &#8220;discarded drafts&#8221; normally get deleted after seven days, and it&#8217;s already been six days since the release. If we were able to rescue your draft, you&#8217;ll see it on the &#8220;All Posts&#8221; screen after you update to 3.8.3. (We&#8217;ll also be pushing 3.8.3 out as a background update, so you may just see a draft appear.)</p>\n<p>So, if you tried to jot down a quick idea last week, I hope WordPress has recovered it for you.

(If things broke, we&#8217;d like to hear about them so we can make adjustments.) For more, see TinyMCE&#8217;s <a href="http://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/Tutorial:Migration_guide_from_3.x">migration guide</a> and <a href="http://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/api4:index">API documentation</a>, and the notes on the <a href="//make.wordpress.org/core/2014/01/18/tinymce-4-0-is-in-core/">core development blog</a>.</li>\n<li>WordPress 3.9 now uses the MySQLi Improved extension for sites running PHP 5.5. Any plugins that made direct calls to <code>mysql_*</code> functions will experience some problems on these sites. For more information, see the notes on the <a href="//make.wordpress.org/core/2014/04/07/mysql-in-wordpress-3-9/">core development blog</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Be sure to follow along the core development blog, where we will be continuing to post <a href="//make.wordpress.org/core/tag/3-9-dev-notes/">notes for developers for 3.9</a>.

Andrew Nacin <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/08/21/introducing-plugin-icons-in-the-plugin-installer/" target="_blank">announced</a> today that plugins will also have their own icons in the installer.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/akismet-details.png" rel="prettyphoto[28923]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/akismet-details.png?resize=651%2C235" alt="akismet-details" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28927" /></a></p>\n<p>Plugin authors are at liberty to create their own custom 128px square icons, as seen in the Akismet example above. Nacin outlines the specific criteria for custom icons in the announcement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Plugin icons are 128 pixels square. HiDPI (retina) icons are supported at 256 pixels square. Like banners, these go into your /assets directory and can be either a PNG or JPG. So just create assets/icon-128&#215;128.(png|jpg) and/or assets/icon-256&#215;256.(png|jpg) and you have an icon.</p>\n<p>You also have another option: SVG. Vectors are perfect for icons like this, as they can be scaled to any size and the file itself is small. For an SVG file, you simply need an assets/icon.svg file.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If a plugin does not have a custom icon in place, an auto-generated icon will appear in the installer instead. Default icons are created from a color sampling of your plugin banner (done via <a href="https://github.com/mtias/tonesque" target="_blank">Tonesque</a>) and generated using the <a href="https://github.com/jasonlong/geo_patter" target="_blank">Geo Pattern</a> library. This is all the more reason to add a custom banner to your plugin&#8217;s page on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/geo-patterns.png" rel="prettyphoto[28923]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/geo-patterns.png?resize=654%2C393" alt="geo-patterns" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28936" /></a></p>\n<p>Nacin credits <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/tellyworth" target="_blank">Alex Shiels</a> for his work on this beautiful new feature for the plugin installer.</p>\n<p>If you are a plugin author and you want to have a custom icon in place when WordPress 4.0 launches, you can add one now. A custom icon will help your plugin stand out among the auto-generated icons. Check out Nacin&#8217;s <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/08/21/introducing-plugin-icons-in-the-plugin-installer/" target="_blank">tips on creating a custom icon</a> for more information.  WordPress 4.0 will be landing <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/version-4-0-project-schedule/" target="_blank">the week of August 25th</a>. While you&#8217;re adding your icon, there&#8217;s still plenty of time to test your plugin with 4.0 to ensure its compatibility.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 21 Aug 2014 19:45:54 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"WPTavern: Free WordPress Superuser Training Course from WordPress.com VIP";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=28893";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:192:"http://wptavern.com/free-wordpress-supueruser-training-course-from-wordpress-com-vip?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=free-wordpress-supueruser-training-course-from-wordpress-com-vip";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3972:"<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/training.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[28893]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/training.jpg?resize=1024%2C488" alt="photo credit: Kris Krug - cc" class="size-full wp-image-28917" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kk/4166628455/">Kris Krug</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p>The folks at WordPress.com VIP are continuing to add to <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-vip-releases-presentation-documents-and-resources-under-creative-commons-license" target="_blank">Documattic</a>, a repository dedicated to sharing presentations and resources with the WordPress community.

It helps new WordPress administrators get up to speed on managing content and even contains exercises for students to practice during the course.

The slides are not meant to stand alone but rather to serve as a tool for teachers to train site administrators, site owners, and editors of large multi-author sites.</p>\n<p>You can put videos and tutorials inside the WordPress admin, but nothing replaces a hands-on teaching experience. It is by far the best way to build confidence in new administrators.

Once installed, it adds a search bar to filter the &#8220;My Sites&#8221; menu in WordPress multisite. It narrows the site list down as you type, making it simple to locate a site in your list.</p>\n<p>Before you install the plugin, your site list might look something like this:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/before.png" rel="prettyphoto[28859]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/before.png?resize=341%2C694" alt="before" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28869" /></a></p>\n<p>With My Sites Search installed, you&#8217;ll have a search bar added to the top of the &#8220;My Sites&#8221; dropdown, allowing you to quickly navigate to any of your sites on the network.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/after.png" rel="prettyphoto[28859]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/after.png?resize=398%2C433" alt="after" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28868" /></a></p>\n<p>As soon as I saw the plugin, I had to test it, having come up against this problem many times. It works exactly as advertised. My Sites Search is especially useful on closed networks where the super admin user has set up all of the sites. This normally results in a long &#8220;My Sites&#8221; list, as opposed to networks with open registration where users generally only register one site apiece.</p>\n<p>Small enhancements like this can help to make your super admin life easier. If your &#8220;My Sites&#8221; dropdown is getting out of control, download the <a href="https://github.com/trepmal/my-sites-search" target="_blank">My Sites Search</a> plugin from GiHub.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 21 Aug 2014 08:01:23 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"WPTavern: Updates to VaultPress Result In 25%-90% Faster Restore Builds";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=28851";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:182:"http://wptavern.com/updates-to-vaultpress-result-in-25-90-faster-restore-builds?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=updates-to-vaultpress-result-in-25-90-faster-restore-builds";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1759:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/RoadRunnerFeaturedImage.png" rel="prettyphoto[28851]"><img class="size-full wp-image-28853" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/RoadRunnerFeaturedImage.png?resize=639%2C260" alt="RoadRunner Featured Image" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/steevithak/3292372292/">steevithak</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p>VaultPress has <a title="http://blog.vaultpress.com/2014/08/18/how-vaultpress-works/" href="http://blog.vaultpress.com/2014/08/18/how-vaultpress-works/">announced</a> that a recent update to their backup systems have reduced the time required to build restore files by anywhere from 25%-90%. Before the change, VaultPress stored each SQL row in a separate file in its replicated file system which slowed down restore times.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Before the VaultPress update, we were storing each SQL row in a separate file in our replicated filesystem. That slowed our restore times, because each table had to be regenerated from potentially millions of individual files.</p>\n<p>Now we store table dumps and changes, building a restore typically involves far fewer files per table.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To go along with the decrease in restore times, the post also explains how the service works.

You&#8217;ll see that you cannot create a spritemap until you upload a few SVGs.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/svg-spritemap.png" rel="prettyphoto[28766]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28768" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/svg-spritemap.png?resize=780%2C250" alt="svg-spritemap" /></a></p>\n<p>The usage instructions outline the general workflow for using SVG Spritemaps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install and activate the WordPress plugin.</li>\n<li>Add SVG images through the Media Uploader.</li>\n<li>Select the SVGs for the spritemap in Settings &gt; Media &gt; SVG Spritemap.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can add SVGs to the medial library as you normally would and they will be displayed like any other file.

This may or may not be important to you. Jonathan Neal, the plugin&#8217;s author, has created a way around this with his <a href="https://github.com/jonathantneal/svg4everybody" target="_blank">SVG for Everybody</a> project, which adds special assistance to browsers to display external SVG spritemaps.</p>\n<p>If you want an easy way to add SVGs to WordPress and create your own SVG spritemap, this plugin gives you a nice interface for generating it automatically. After testing, I can confirm that it works as advertised.

WordPress 3.9 <a href="http://wptavern.com/widget-customizer-approved-for-wordpress-3-9" target="_blank">added widgets to the customizer</a> and the 4.0 release is set to expand the role of the feature into other aspects of WordPress with <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28477" target="_blank">support for a wider array of controls</a>.</p>\n<p>Developers are eager to find new ways to harness the power of the customizer without getting caught up in writing a ton of code. Devin Price, co-owner of <a href="https://devpress.com/" target="_blank">DevPress</a>, is working on a new project to create a <a href="https://github.com/devinsays/customizer-library" target="_blank">Customizer Library</a>. The library is designed to abstract out some of the complexity of working with the customizer so that developers can easily add options by defining a simple array.</p>\n<p>Price <a href="http://wptheming.com/2014/08/customizer-library/" target="_blank">describes</a> the Customizer Library as &#8220;a collection of classes and functions that make it a bit easier to develop for the WordPress Customizer.&#8221; The library currently includes helper functions for Google fonts and inline styles, but he&#8217;s considering removing them into their own repositories in order to keep the project more focused for general use.</p>\n<p>The library can be included in a theme or plugin as a git submodule, according to the <a href="https://github.com/devinsays/customizer-library#installation" target="_blank">installation instructions</a>.  Price has built in only one custom control, for textarea, but he plans to add additional custom controls as the library matures. It currently supports the following options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Checkbox</li>\n<li>Select</li>\n<li>Radio</li>\n<li>Upload</li>\n<li>Color</li>\n<li>Textarea</li>\n<li>Select (Typography)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An example theme can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/devinsays/customizer-library-demo" target="_blank">Customizer Library Demo</a> repository, which shows how to use the library to create options such as logo, primary and secondary colors, textareas, checkboxes, etc.</p>\n<p>The Customizer Library project is somewhat similar to the <a href="http://wptavern.com/kirki-a-free-plugin-to-style-the-wordpress-customizer-and-add-advanced-controls" target="_blank">Kirki plugin</a>, which aims to provide a framework for adding advanced controls. Although the projects are constructed differently, they both abstract the Customizer API to make it easier to add options. As the customizer evolves to become more powerful with more controls, libraries/frameworks like these provide an entry point for developers who want a quick way to build options.</p>\n<p>If you want to use the customizer in your projects but are having trouble getting a handle on it, the<a href="https://github.com/devinsays/customizer-library" target="_blank"> Customzer Library</a> might be a reasonable starting place. Price is looking for feedback and suggestions as he continues to develop the library as a standalone project. You can help shape its future by joining the discussion on the <a href="http://wptheming.com/2014/08/customizer-library/" target="_blank">post</a> where he introduces the library.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 20 Aug 2014 00:37:12 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"WPTavern: Send to WordPress: Chrome Extension Exports Google Docs to WordPress Posts";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=28666";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:210:"http://wptavern.com/send-to-wordpress-chrome-extension-exports-google-docs-to-wordpress-posts?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=send-to-wordpress-chrome-extension-exports-google-docs-to-wordpress-posts";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4354:"<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/paper-airplane.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[28666]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/paper-airplane.jpg?resize=1024%2C495" alt="photo credit: davekellam - cc" class="size-full wp-image-28710" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/davekellam/8916554/">davekellam</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a Google chrome user, there are many free extensions out there that are useful for getting other applications to work with WordPress. Earlier this year we shared a collection of <a href="http://wptavern.com/10-free-chrome-extensions-for-wordpress-users" target="_blank">Chrome extensions for WordPress users</a>, many of which are specifically tailored toward content creation.</p>\n<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/send-to-wordpress/nbljnjmeckdecofjohdobgmleppiikll" target="_blank">Send to WordPress</a> is a handy new extension that recently landed in the Chrome web store. It allows you to export a Google Drive document to WordPress as a post, with all the formatting and images preserved.</p>\n<p>Once the extension is installed, you can create a new WordPress post from a Google document by right clicking one or more documents and selecting <strong>&#8220;Open with&#8221; -> &#8220;Send to WordPress.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/send-to-wordpress.png" rel="prettyphoto[28666]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/send-to-wordpress.png?resize=640%2C400" alt="send-to-wordpress" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28670" /></a></p>\n<p>On the next screen you&#8217;ll be asked to enter your WordPress site URL and login credentials. You have the option to send the post to save as a draft or to publish immediately. You can also elect to use your theme&#8217;s text styles and add images as attachments.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/wordpress-login.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[28666]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/wordpress-login.jpg?resize=601%2C317" alt="wordpress-login" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28674" /></a></p>\n<p>Click &#8220;Create Post(s)&#8221; and your document will be automatically sent to your WordPress site. Once you&#8217;ve verified that it&#8217;s there, you can edit the post and make any further changes. You&#8217;ll find that any images included in your post(s) have been added to your media library.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/draft.png" rel="prettyphoto[28666]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/draft.png?resize=805%2C236" alt="draft" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28677" /></a></p>\n<p>After testing the extension, I found that it adds some unnecessary classes and inline styles to the content that is sent over. This may be something that you will want to clean up, depending on how you formatted the document in Google Drive.</p>\n<h3>Why Not Compose Directly in WordPress?</h3>\n<p>Publishing via the Send to WordPress extension may seem counterintuitive at first. Why not just compose directly within WordPress? One advantage is that when Google Drive is online, you can work with others to collaborate on a post as a group and then have a convenient way to send your work over to WordPress.</p>\n<p>The main benefit of this extension is that it allows you to keep working, even when you cannot access your site.  Google Drive can be <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375012?hl=en&ref_topic=2375188" target="_blank">enabled for working offline</a>, which allows you to organize folders, view your files, and edit Google documents without an internet connection.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re on a long plane ride and the wi-fi isn&#8217;t working or you&#8217;re stuck somewhere without internet, you can continue to write posts, add images, links and formatting in Google Drive. The <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/send-to-wordpress/nbljnjmeckdecofjohdobgmleppiikll" target="_blank">Send to WordPress</a> extension lets you automatically send all of that work over to your WordPress site as soon as you have a connection again.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 19 Aug 2014 21:13:23 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"WPTavern: How to Easily Add Icons to Menus in WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=28664";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:154:"http://wptavern.com/how-to-easily-add-icons-to-menus-in-wordpress?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-to-easily-add-icons-to-menus-in-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4899:"<p>Have you ever found yourself wanting to spice up the navigation menus on your site by adding icons?

The global settings are used by default.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IconSettings.png" rel="prettyphoto[28664]"><img class="size-full wp-image-28673" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IconSettings.png?resize=286%2C244" alt="Settings To Alter The Display Of Icons" /></a>Settings To Alter The Display Of Icons\n<p>One of my favorite features is the ability to use icons from different packs. If a pack doesn&#8217;t have the icon you&#8217;re looking for, chances are, one of the other three does. It only took five minutes to find the right icons for my menus. Without modifying the default settings, this is what my menus looked like on the front end of the site.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/MyMenuIcons.jpeg" rel="prettyphoto[28664]"><img class="size-full wp-image-28672" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/MyMenuIcons.jpeg?resize=759%2C109" alt="The End Result" /></a>The End Result\n<p>The icons become part of the link, just like the text, and they blend in seamlessly. Can you tell which packs these icons belong to? If the icons don&#8217;t look like they&#8217;re aligned correctly, you&#8217;ll need to override the styles in the theme&#8217;s CSS file or use the <a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-custom-css/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-custom-css/">Simple Custom CSS</a> plugin to apply the correct style attributes. In most cases however, the icons should look fine in your theme.</p>\n<h2>Simple Yet Effective</h2>\n<p>Menu Icons is a great, effective plugin. I wish it existed five years ago when I really could have used it. It&#8217;s the easiest way I&#8217;ve come across to add icons to navigation menus in WordPress without having to edit CSS.

Frontend optimization is often further down on the list but can have a tremendous effect on performance. One of the most common frontend optimization techniques is to concatenate and minify your resources, which reduces the number of requests as well as the file size of the resources requested.</p>\n<p>The process of &#8220;minifying&#8221; eliminates wasted space in the scripts and stylesheets, which makes them much smaller and able to load faster. Combining (“concatenating”) multiple scripts reduces the number of requests, allowing you to download more assets in parallel to speed things up.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/dependency-minification/" target="_blank">Dependency Minification</a> is a plugin that will automatically concatenate and minify scripts and stylesheets for you. It&#8217;s a reincarnation and rewrite of the X-Team&#8217;s popular <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/optimize-scripts/" target="_blank">Optimize Scripts</a> plugin, which is now officially retired.</p>\n<p>Dependency Minification grabs scripts and stylesheets that have been added via wp_enqueue_script and wp_enqueue_style and automatically concatenates and minifies them into logical groups using WP-Cron. When you first install it and visit the settings page, you&#8217;ll see a notice:</p>\n<p><em>There are no minified dependencies yet. Try browsing the site.</em></p>\n<p>After you browse the frontend (which activates WP-Cron) and then visit the settings page, you&#8217;ll see that the process of minifying and concatenating resources has begun:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/dependency-minification-settings.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[27649]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/dependency-minification-settings.jpg?resize=1025%2C484" alt="dependency-minification-settings" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28624" /></a></p>\n<p>How do you know it&#8217;s working? In addition to the information on the plugin&#8217;s settings page, you can view the source of your site. Minified and concatenated dependencies will appear in your code with /_minify/ in the path similar to this:</p>\n<pre class="brush: xml; light: true; title: ; notranslate">&lt;script type=\'text/javascript\' src=\'/_minify/wp_favico_js,wp_favicon_js,previewloader,pinterestRSSjs,yumprint-recipe-post,flexslider.df2e3e1be0c951f4cf3ea0932200f96c.314e77c0b7be97ba8913570dcc5ada67.js\'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n<p>Mouseover any group of dependencies on the settings page and you&#8217;ll see three options:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/script-options.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[27649]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/script-options.jpg?resize=581%2C151" alt="script-options" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28630" /></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Expire</strong> &#8211; Expire this item to gracefully regenerate</li>\n<li><strong>Purge</strong> &#8211; Purge item from cache (deletes immediately, not often recommended)</li>\n<li><strong>View Minified</strong> &#8211; View minified dependencies in a new window</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The minified sources are stored in the wp_options table, which means that no special filesystem access is required. The plugin also includes a filter to exclude dependencies that you don&#8217;t want to be minified. A few other important things to know about the plugin&#8217;s features and how they can be customized:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Endpoint for minified requests is at /_minified, which can be configured.</li>\n<li>Dependencies hosted on other domains are excluded by default, but this behavior can be changed by filtering the default_exclude_remote_dependencies option via the dependency_minification_options filter, or on a case-by-case basis via the filter previously mentioned.</li>\n<li>Stale minified scripts and stylesheets remain until replaced by refreshed ones; this ensures that full-page caches which reference stale minified sources won&#8217;t result in any 404s.</li>\n<li>Transforms relatives paths in stylesheets (e.g. background-images) to absolute ones, so that they don&#8217;t 404.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WordPress super admins will be glad to know that Dependency Minification is also multisite-compatible. If you want to use it on a multisite network, the plugin&#8217;s instructions advise you to install and activate <a href="http://scribu.net/" target="_blank">scribu</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/proper-network-activation/" target="_blank">Proper Network Activation</a> plugin before activating it network-wide.</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/dependency-minification/" target="_blank">Dependency Minification</a> plugin is supported by a large group of experienced developers who continue to improve it. They have built a decent amount of flexibility into the plugin with several filters that allow you to control and tweak its default behavior. If you don&#8217;t need to modify how it works, the plugin is pretty much plug-and-play. It provides a quick and simple way to concatenate and minify resources on your site, without a ton of options to configure.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 18 Aug 2014 23:10:55 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"WPTavern: WPChat Relaunches as a Forum Dedicated to WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=28616";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:166:"http://wptavern.com/wpchat-relaunches-as-a-forum-dedicated-to-wordpress?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wpchat-relaunches-as-a-forum-dedicated-to-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4934:"<p>A few years ago, <a title="http://leland.me" href="http://leland.me">Leland Fiegel</a> created a site called <a title="http://wpchat.com" href="http://wpchat.com">WPChat</a>. The site contained an iFrame with an embedded IRC client pointed to Freenode. It provided easy access to IRC where at anytime during the week, users could chat about WordPress. Here&#8217;s what the old site looked like.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/OldWPChat.gif" rel="prettyphoto[28616]"><img class="size-full wp-image-28618" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/OldWPChat.gif?resize=695%2C424" alt="What The Old WPChat Used To Look Like" /></a>What The Old WPChat Used To Look Like\n<p>After being dormant for the past year or two, Fiegel has turned the site into a dedicated forum devoted to WordPress topics.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/WPChatRunningDiscourse.jpeg" rel="prettyphoto[28616]"><img class="size-full wp-image-28619" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/WPChatRunningDiscourse.jpeg?resize=1025%2C534" alt="WPChat Running Discourse" /></a>WPChat Running Discourse\n<p>The site is powered by <a title="http://www.discourse.org/" href="http://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a>, an open source, GPL licensed, discussion platform created by Jeff Atwood. In a <a title="http://leland.me/wpchat-discourse/" href="http://leland.me/wpchat-discourse/">post published on his personal site</a>, Fiegel explains why he chose Discourse over other forum software such as bbPress, or phpBB.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Discourse just has a more modern feel to it. The instant flow of discussions, the notification features, it just feels much more like a chatroom, rather than a more traditional piece of forum software.</p>\n<p>I felt it fit much more inline with the “brand” of WPChat, and just thought people would enjoy using it better.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Over the weekend, I had the privilege of being one of the first members to the forum. It loads quick and is intuitive to use. The site works great on mobile devices. I&#8217;m able to administer, respond to, and create threads easily from my phone.</p>\n<h2>Discourse Is a Breath Of Fresh Air</h2>\n<p>Discourse is a fresh take on using forums for community discussion. One of the unique attributes it has is a trust system. As members spend more time replying to and creating more threads, their trust level increases. Higher trust levels provide more capabilities to the user, allowing them to take on a larger role of moderating the forum. I find this to be an interesting approach and wonder how well it does on large, established forums.</p>\n<p><a title="http://blog.discourse.org/2014/06/discourse-v1-0-next-month/" href="http://blog.discourse.org/2014/06/discourse-v1-0-next-month/">Discourse 1.0</a> has yet to materialize but according to the blog, it&#8217;s right around the corner. Since it&#8217;s only a year old, there&#8217;s not much in the way of a third-party ecosystem. If you plan to install Discourse on your own server, be aware of the <a title="http://www.discourse.org/faq/#tech" href="http://www.discourse.org/faq/#tech">minimum requirements</a>. As Fiegel mentions in his post, it&#8217;s not as easy to install as WordPress.</p>\n<h2>A Forum Outside Of WordPress.org</h2>\n<p>While there is a <a title="https://plus.google.com/communities/101504763068635549461" href="https://plus.google.com/communities/101504763068635549461">Google+ group</a> devoted to WordPress and other <a title="http://wptavern.com/add-these-subreddits-to-your-list-of-wordpress-watering-holes" href="http://wptavern.com/add-these-subreddits-to-your-list-of-wordpress-watering-holes">watering holes</a>, the closest one that feels like a forum to me is the <a title="http://wptavern.com/a-facebook-group-dedicated-to-advanced-wordpress-topics" href="http://wptavern.com/a-facebook-group-dedicated-to-advanced-wordpress-topics">Advanced WordPress</a> user group on Facebook. However, Facebook groups in general lack significant features that make them useful such as threads and an easy way to locate previous discussions. You&#8217;re also tied to Facebook in terms of what you can do with the data.</p>\n<p>Ever since the WP Tavern forum disappeared, I&#8217;ve been looking for somewhere on the web to hang out and chat about WordPress.

You&#8217;ll be able to view the author who uploaded the image and the <a title="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_get_post_parent_id" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_get_post_parent_id">post parent ID</a> it&#8217;s attached to.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/UploadInformation.png" rel="prettyphoto[28598]"><img class="size-full wp-image-28600" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/UploadInformation.png?resize=289%2C235" alt="Uploaded By and Uploaded To Informatiom" /></a>Uploaded By and Uploaded To Information\n<p>I find this information to be useful, especially for multi-author websites. Although you can view the parent post ID the image is attached to, you can&#8217;t locate each post the image is used on. It&#8217;s important to note the difference between an image <strong>attached to a post</strong> and using <strong>an image already available</strong> in the media library.</p>\n<h2>Why Knowing Where An Image Is Used Comes In Handy</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say I use a featured image for a post and it&#8217;s the featured image for several other posts. If I want to change the featured image in one post and have it change in every other post, I can&#8217;t. I also can&#8217;t change the image for specific posts automatically, it&#8217;s either all or nothing. I can&#8217;t determine which posts are using the image because WordPress only sees it being used on the parent post. This is due to the attachment relationship.</p>\n<p>In other words, the first post the image is attached to is the only information WordPress has on where it&#8217;s being used. I could browse to every post and manually change it but my memory isn&#8217;t that good and it&#8217;s a tedious process.</p>\n<h2>The History Behind The Dilemma</h2>\n<p>In trying to figure out why this is, Justin Tadlock pointed out two Trac tickets, <a title="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10657" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10657">10657</a> and <a title="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14513" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14513">14513</a>. Both contain lengthy, technical discussions, on how to add support for many-to-many relationships between posts and attachments in WordPress. Within the discussions, the <a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/posts-to-posts/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/posts-to-posts/">Posts 2 Posts</a> plugin is commonly referred to as <a title="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14513#comment:101" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14513#comment:101">a top-notch plugin</a> that offers this functionality.</p>\n<p>Before the Community Summit in October of 2012, Andrew Nacin and a host of other WordPress developers came together to discuss the subject in detail. The ideas brought forth from that conversation are available on the Make.WordPress.com blog and is a <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/07/28/potential-roadmap-for-taxonomy-meta-and-post-relationships/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/07/28/potential-roadmap-for-taxonomy-meta-and-post-relationships/">potential roadmap</a> for taxonomy meta and post relationships in WordPress.</p>\n<h2>It&#8217;s Possible But Not Worth The Hassle</h2>\n<p>WordPress automatically renames files if it detects the same name being used in the media library. This means you can&#8217;t upload a new image with the same file name to replace it. An alternative method is to use FTP to locate the original file and overwrite it, keeping the same name. The image will change in all posts using it, regardless of the attachment details. You&#8217;ll also need to overwrite any images that were resized automatically by WordPress or else they&#8217;ll show up instead of the new ones.</p>\n<p>After performing all sorts of tests in my local environment for trying to change one image across multiple posts, I&#8217;ve decided it&#8217;s too much of a hassle. Not being able to manage these relationships in WordPress doesn&#8217;t make sense. Ideally, I&#8217;d like to be able to determine which posts are using an image and replace that image across all of those posts at the same time. I also wouldn&#8217;t mind the flexibility to change an image for certain posts while leaving the others alone.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 18 Aug 2014 22:15:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"WPTavern: _s_backbone: A WordPress Starter Theme Based on Underscores and Backbone.js";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=28545";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:212:"http://wptavern.com/_s_backbone-a-wordpress-starter-theme-based-on-underscores-and-backbone-js?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=_s_backbone-a-wordpress-starter-theme-based-on-underscores-and-backbone-js";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7139:"<p>The <a href="http://underscores.me" target="_blank">Underscores</a> WordPress starter theme has seen a flurry of activity in recent days, <a href="http://wptavern.com/underscores-wordpress-starter-theme-adds-support-for-sass" target="_blank">adding support for Sass</a> and <a href="https://philiparthurmoore.com/underscores-gets-automated-testing/" target="_blank">automated testing</a> with <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/_s/issues/553" target="_blank">Travis CI</a>. The theme has been forked more than 1300 times on GitHub with many interesting variations created to support various theme features and frameworks.</p>\n<p>One fork in particular is getting WordPress theme developers excited about the possibility of bringing in new Javascript-powered features. <a href="https://github.com/tlovett1/_s_backbone" target="_blank">_s_backbone</a> is a new theme based off of Underscores that incorporates the WordPress REST API <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/client-js" target="_blank">Backbone.js client</a>.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/s_backbone.png" rel="prettyphoto[28545]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/s_backbone.png?resize=1025%2C871" alt="_s_backbone" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28553" /></a></p>\n<p><a href="http://taylorlovett.com/" target="_blank">Taylor Lovett</a>, Director of Web Engineering at <a href="http://10up.com/" target="_blank">@10up</a>, created the theme as a proof of concept but also hopes that it will become a useful tool for theme developers who want to get started using the WP REST API. The API is <a href="http://wptavern.com/json-rest-api-slated-for-wordpress-4-1-release">slated for inclusion in WordPress 4.1</a>.</p>\n<h3>Advantages of Using Backbone for Infinite Scroll</h3>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/s_backbone_theme.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[28545]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/s_backbone_theme.jpg?resize=1025%2C430" alt="_s_backbone_theme" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28587" /></a></p>\n<p>So how is _s_backbone different from vanilla Underscores? The major difference here is that the loops have infinite scroll built in using a &#8220;more&#8221; button, a feature powered by the Backbone client which grabs posts on the fly without reloading the page. This provides several advantages. &#8220;On the web today, people expect reactive, dynamic web applications. I think everyone can agree the web is shifting to a more JavaScript reliant place,&#8221; Lovett told the Tavern. &#8220;Powering your loops using JSON REST API&#8217;s Backbone client is the easiest way for you to add and customize infinite scroll to your website.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Adding infinite scroll to a theme using other methods can be a frustrating, complicated experience. &#8220;There are a few advantages to building infinite scroll with the JSON REST API as opposed to something else,&#8221; Lovett said. &#8220;The JSON REST API will be merged into WordPress so your code will always be backwards compatible. With the JSON REST API and Backbone client, you don&#8217;t have to build your own endpoints which is time consuming. Also, the JSON REST API is, well, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank">RESTful</a> making it extremely easy to use.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I asked Lovett how _s_backbone&#8217;s implementation of infinite scrolling differs from <a href="http://jetpack.me/support/infinite-scroll/" target="_blank">Jetpack&#8217;s module</a>. Is this feature something that functions better as part of a theme vs. a plugin?</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve worked extensively with Jetpack&#8217;s Infinite Scroll module. In fact, _s_backbone takes some code from it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think valid arguments can be presented for including infinite scroll in either a plugin or a theme. However, I think with the advent of the JSON REST API and Backbone client, adding infinite scroll to the theme makes more sense.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although the theme&#8217;s main attraction right now is a new way to power infinite scrolling, Lovett hopes that _s_backbone can provide a starting place for developers to create their own Backbone-powered features.</p>\n<blockquote><p>_s_backbone is a starter theme, not a parent theme. Decisions are left to the theme developer. If the developer feels like it, they can rip out infinite scroll completely or put it in a plugin. The goal is to provide the theme developer with a good base with which to start and let them build from there.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the future, Lovett plans to add post format support to the theme, as it&#8217;s currently missing that feature. &#8220;I&#8217;m hoping to get some feedback on the starter theme to best assess what would be most useful to developers,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<h3>The WP REST API Opens Up New Opportunities for Theme and Plugin Developers</h3>\n<p>Lovett will be speaking this weekend at <a href="http://2014.boston.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">WordCamp Boston</a> on the WP JSON REST API where he hopes to use the _s_backbone theme as an example. His largest contribution to the WP REST API project has been the creation of the <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/client-js" target="_blank">Backbone.js client</a>. He also contributes on the PHP side, assisting with post meta, comments, and revision endpoints.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very excited about the implications of the JSON REST API in the backend,&#8221; Taylor commented on the future of the project. &#8220;I believe the JSON REST API will be incredibly useful internally, especially cross-site (in multisite). I&#8217;ve written many endpoints to retrieve different custom post types for backend features that could be dramatically simplified with the JSON REST API. Also, I think it will simplify the code powering the media library.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lovett hopes to introduce developers to all the possibilities of using the API while at WordCamp Boston. &#8220;First and foremost, I want to show people why the API is useful and how you can use it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want to inspire plugin and theme developers to build amazing things with the API. I believe a RESTful API within WordPress opens up a lot of doors. I&#8217;d also like to show people how you can grab data from other websites that use the API instead of parsing feeds.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re familiar with Underscores, then Lovett&#8217;s new <a href="https://github.com/tlovett1/_s_backbone" target="_blank">_s_backbone</a> theme is a nice starting point for learning more about using the API in a theme. Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/tlovett1/_s_backbone/issues" target="_blank">leave feedback</a> on the project regarding additional features you&#8217;d like to see powered by Backbone. If you&#8217;re interested in contributing to the<a href="https://github.com/wp-api" target="_blank"> WP API project</a>, the Backbone.js client, or elsewhere, Lovett encourages you to get involved, as the team is always looking for more help.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 18 Aug 2014 17:57:39 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Matt: Commercial Whaling Ship";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=44017";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"http://ma.tt/2014/08/commercial-whalingship/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:347:"<p><a href="http://www.clickhole.com/blogpost/time-i-spent-commercial-whaling-ship-totally-chang-768">The Time I Spent On A Commercial Whaling Ship Totally Changed My Perspective On The World</a> &#8212; I know the title sounds baity but this is the best writing I&#8217;ve read online in a while, almost like it&#8217;s from a different time.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 18 Aug 2014 15:39:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Matt Mullenweg";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"Akismet: Akismet 3.0.2 for WordPress Available";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1640";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://blog.akismet.com/2014/08/18/akismet-3-0-2-for-wordpress-available/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:931:"<p>Version 3.0.2 of <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/">the Akismet plugin for WordPress</a> is now available.</p>\n<p>In version 3.0.2, we&#8217;ve improved performance and fixed a bug that could have negatively affected Akismet&#8217;s ability to determine whether a comment is spam.</p>\n<p>To upgrade, visit the Updates page of your WordPress dashboard and follow the instructions.

title="http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-February/017888.html" href="http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-February/017888.html">particular debate that has been going on for years</a> on whether WordPress is a CMS or not. CMSCritic has a great article by Kaya Ismail, that explains why <a title="http://www.cmscritic.com/wordpress-is-a-cms-whether-you-like-it-or-not/" href="http://www.cmscritic.com/wordpress-is-a-cms-whether-you-like-it-or-not/">WordPress is a CMS (Whether You Like it or Not)</a>. It&#8217;s one of the most refreshing perspectives I&#8217;ve read on the subject. The definition of a Content Management System is <em>a web application designed to make it easy for non-technical users to add, edit and manage a website</em>. WordPress fits that definition rather well and in many respects, excels at it. The problem as Ismail explains, is that the acronym has become muddied over the years.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The issue arises when the stripped down, true meaning of &#8220;CMS&#8221; is blown up with unnecessary jargon. In reality, those definitions hold very little weight, other than when they describe added marketing or administrative extras. The fact of the matter is, WordPress fits the definition of a CMS perfectly.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress has grown up to be far more than just a blogging tool. It&#8217;s used to power apps, run large content heavy websites, and e-commerce. The reputation that it&#8217;s just a blogging tool and not a CMS is false.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious on how to use WordPress as a CMS, <a title="http://planetozh.com/blog/2009/09/the-definitive-guide-to-using-wordpress-as-a-cms/" href="http://planetozh.com/blog/2009/09/the-definitive-guide-to-using-wordpress-as-a-cms/">read this guide</a> published by Ozh Richards that contains a simple four step process. It&#8217;s a process nearly all WordPress users go through everyday.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It isn&#8217;t particularly amazing in any niche other than blogging, and it sacrifices being a powerhouse when it comes to things like <a href="http://www.cmscritic.com/dir/dam/">digital asset management</a> for the sake of simplicity. Yet at the same time, WordPress <strong> is </strong> a content management system, and a good one at that.</p>\n<p><strong>So, maybe it&#8217;s time everybody got over it</strong>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ismail sums it up rather well. I think it&#8217;s time to kick this debate to the curb.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 15 Aug 2014 20:38:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"WPTavern: Under the Hood of Semplice: A New Portfolio System Based on WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=27810";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:200:"http://wptavern.com/under-the-hood-of-semplice-a-new-portfolio-system-based-on-wordpress?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=under-the-hood-of-semplice-a-new-portfolio-system-based-on-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7120:"<p><a href="http://www.semplicelabs.com/" target="_blank">Semplice</a> has soft-launched its new WordPress-powered portfolio system. The commercial project popped up on our radar after debuting its extraordinary implementation of the WordPress content editor. Founded by German designers <a href="http://www.style-force.net/" target="_blank">Michael Schmidt</a> and <a href="http://www.vanschneider.com/" target="_blank">Tobias van Schneider</a>, Semplice is breaking onto the scene with high impact designs and its own radically simplified content editor.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/semplice.png" rel="prettyphoto[27810]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/semplice.png?resize=1025%2C749" alt="semplice" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28495" /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Semplice is and was built based on our own needs to create beautiful case studies and branded pages, mainly for designer and artist portfolios,&#8221; Van Schneider told the Tavern. &#8220;Our goal is to create a completely new high quality experience on top of WordPress, something you haven’t seen before,&#8221; he said. So far they appear to be achieving exactly that. <a href="http://www.verenamichelitsch.com/" target="_blank">Example</a> <a href="http://ph7labs.com/" target="_blank">portfolios</a> <a href="http://dannyjongerius.nl/" target="_blank">built</a> with Semplice are nothing less than stunning.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/semplice_adam.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[27810]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/semplice_adam.jpg?resize=1025%2C641" alt="semplice_adam" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28502" /></a></p>\n<h3>A Unique Content Editor</h3>\n<p>Semplice incorporates its own visual content editor which allows users to create unique branded pages or extensive case studies for their projects, without a single line of code. &#8220;We aim to create a flexible system, not a template,&#8221; Van Schneider said. &#8220;With Semplice you start mostly with a white canvas, not a template or theme where you just fill in the blanks.&#8221; Every project is 100% responsive and the content editor is completely tailored to creating a portfolio.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/semplice-content-editor.png" rel="prettyphoto[27810]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/semplice-content-editor.png?resize=720%2C618" alt="semplice-content-editor" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27813" /></a></p>\n<h2>So what&#8217;s under the hood?</h2>\n<p>As beautiful as the front-end results are, we were most curious about what&#8217;s under the hood and assumed it was based on custom post types. On the contrary, the Semplice crew has taken a different route to create this unique editing experience.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For the basic theme options we use <a href="http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/" target="_blank">Advanced Custom Fields</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/elliotcondon" target="_blank">Elliot Condon</a>,&#8221; Van Schneider said. &#8220;The Content Editor itself is a combination of a Javascript frontend that uses the WordPress Ajax functions to communicate with the PHP backend.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As we worked on different Semplice iterations we quickly learned that we need something more than just Custom Post Types, especially since the performance suffered a lot in the beginning,&#8221; he explained. The Semplice content editor is optional and can be activated when creating new pages in WordPress. It includes a live preview as you edit on the frontend, as you can see in the video example below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>&#8220;What you build is exactly what you get,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This allows you to create very flexible editorial layouts for designers or artists who want to present their work in the best light possible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Semplice also allows users the ability to brand every page with a unique visual look. Instead of having pages follow a set template, elements such as background color, navigation, and typography can be customized for each.</p>\n<p>The regular WordPress admin is still in play, for example, when a user adds new work. It starts off in the backend with branding and image options.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/add-new-work.png" rel="prettyphoto[27810]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/add-new-work.png?resize=1025%2C740" alt="add-new-work" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28517" /></a></p>\n<p>One unique feature of Semplice is the ability to easily add a new custom fontset to WordPress using the web service of your choice. This is especially important for designers who require unique fonts for presenting their work.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/custom-fontset.png" rel="prettyphoto[27810]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/custom-fontset.png?resize=1025%2C739" alt="custom-fontset" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28520" /></a></p>\n<p>Semplice is geared toward both experienced WordPress users, as well as those who are totally new to the platform. &#8220;Yes, we do aim for people who are familiar with WordPress since they will be able to take Semplice even further than what we offer,&#8221; Van Schneider said. &#8220;But with our Semplice Content Editor we even aim at people who don’t have that much experience with WordPress itself since you don’t really need it.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Licensing, Pricing, and Support</h3>\n<p>Introductory <a href="http://www.semplicelabs.com/get-semplice" target="_blank">Semplice pricing</a> for a single domain is $69 and $299 for an agency. Semplice will be launching without offering customer support and is unusual in that it doesn&#8217;t offer any refunds. Support is limited to the first seven days after purchase. The team will assist with anything related to the default Semplice features and is currently working on establishing a pool of <a href="https://vimeo.com/semplicelabs" target="_blank">video tutorials</a> for documentation.</p>\n<p>While the Semplice team cannot yet offer full product support, they are committed to delivering critical free updates to existing customers. The software is licensed under the GPL. Although Semplice hasn&#8217;t launched yet, early adopters can purchase the software now for a reduced price.</p>\n<p>While the Semplice content editor appeals to new WordPress users, they will still need to overcome the hurdle of installing and setting up a WordPress site on their own domains. Even with 1-click installers, the process can be more difficult than you might imagine for designers and artists with no WordPress experience. Without a fully hosted Semplice platform, the software is going to have to appeal to seasoned WordPress users who appreciate its unique take on building a fullscreen branded portfolio. Do you think Semplice can win out over other theme and plugin-based options?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 15 Aug 2014 20:05:51 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"WPTavern: A Survival Guide To WordCamps For First Time Attendees";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=28486";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:172:"http://wptavern.com/a-survival-guide-to-wordcamps-for-first-time-attendees?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=a-survival-guide-to-wordcamps-for-first-time-attendees";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2348:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SurvivalGuideFeaturedImage.png" rel="prettyphoto[28486]"><img class="size-full wp-image-28489" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SurvivalGuideFeaturedImage.png?resize=639%2C207" alt="Survival Guide Featured Image" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ari/4166542615/">Steve Rhodes</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p><a title="http://central.wordcamp.org/" href="http://central.wordcamp.org/">WordCamps</a> are excellent opportunities to learn WordPress and have of face-to-face interaction with a lot of different people. They can also be exhausting and possibly stressful for first timers. Carrie Dils has an awesome <a title="http://www.carriedils.com/wordcamp-tips/" href="http://www.carriedils.com/wordcamp-tips/">WordCamp Survival Guide</a> filled with tips and information on how to get the most out of these events.</p>\n<p>Tip number five (don&#8217;t sit by yourself at lunch) routinely happens to me at WordCamps.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When the last morning session breaks, there will be a mad dash to the lunch line (did someone say “food?!”). You’ll grab a sack lunch lovingly provided by some volunteer and then you’ll stand there, possibly awkward and not sure where to go. It’s lunch on the first day at a new school all over again.</p>\n<p>Try this: Head over to any table with open spots and simply ask to sit down. Unless you just really need that lunch break for personal time, don’t miss an opportunity to meet folks over lunch!</p></blockquote>\n<p>I struggle with introducing myself to people I&#8217;ve never met before. At WordCamps, I&#8217;m generally extroverted but I&#8217;ve noticed at larger camps, I become introverted. It&#8217;s a personality thing I&#8217;ve been fighting with for the past few years with mild success. I keep telling myself that I&#8217;m going to introduce myself to everyone I see at a WordCamp but it never works out that way. I end up finding a group of people I&#8217;m familiar with and stick with them.

Simply set up an RSS -> Twitter action, like <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/rss/twitter/35895/rss-new-item-in-feed-to-twitter-create-tweet/" target="_blank">this one</a> with Zapier:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rss-tweet.png" rel="prettyphoto[28459]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rss-tweet.png?resize=1025%2C207" alt="rss-tweet" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28465" /></a></p>\n<p>Users of <a href="https://ifttt.com/" target="_blank">IFTTT</a> can do the same by creating an RSS to Twitter recipe. You&#8217;ll want to use the <strong>development log feed</strong> on the developers tab of the plugin page. Connecting RSS to Twitter via a service will automate the little tasks involved in promoting your plugin and keeping users up-to-date.</p>\n<h4>Get Notified When a Plugin is Updated</h4>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rss-to-email.png" rel="prettyphoto[28459]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rss-to-email.png?resize=1025%2C426" alt="rss-to-email" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28474" /></a></p>\n<p>Plugin users can also harness the same feed URL to send themselves updates via email. Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve got a few specific plugins that you are watching intently for an update. Perhaps you&#8217;ve notified the plugin author of a bug and are waiting for a fix or a new feature that&#8217;s in development. Instead of checking your site or the plugin&#8217;s page on WordPress.org for updates, you can set up an RSS to Email automated task to pull from the plugin&#8217;s development log feed and shoot a notice to your inbox.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 15 Aug 2014 05:14:36 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"Dev Blog: WordPress 4.0 Beta 4";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=3280";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"http://wordpress.org/news/2014/08/wordpress-4-0-beta-4/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1990:"<p>The fourth and likely final beta for WordPress 4.0 is now available.

The theme was created by Woo Themes designer <a href="http://jameskoster.co.uk/" target="_blank">James Koster</a> as a child theme for his responsive <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/highwind" target="_blank">Highwind</a> parent theme.</p>\n<p>Clear Tranquil lives up to its name, inspiring a light, peaceful reading experience that is clutter-free. The design puts your content in focus.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/clear-tranquil.png" rel="prettyphoto[28368]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/clear-tranquil.png?resize=600%2C450" alt="clear-tranquil" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28372" /></a></p>\n<p>Koster gives meticulous attention to typography and highlights the first character of each post with elegant block letter styles. The theme includes a sticky, understated top navigation menu (optional), and zero widget areas. That&#8217;s right, Clear Tranquil is a completely widget-free zone.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/single-post.png" rel="prettyphoto[28368]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/single-post.png?resize=1025%2C737" alt="single-post" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28451" /></a></p>\n<p>The theme includes a handful of customization options built into WordPress&#8217; native customizer.

Koster hasn&#8217;t set up a live demo of the theme. Ordinarily, the WordPress.org demo gives an unrealistic representation of what a theme will look like. However, in this case, it&#8217;s fairly accurate.</p>\n<p>One of the things that I love about the WordPress theme installation process is that it will automatically install the parent theme for a child theme, if you don&#8217;t already have it installed. In this scenario, if you install Clear Tranquil without Highwind already in place, it will be automatically downloaded for you.</p>\n<p>If your blog has gotten bloated with widgets and is in need of a minimalist makeover, Clear Tranquil might be just the ticket. <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/clear-tranquil" target="_blank">Download</a> it for free from the WordPress Themes Directory.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 14 Aug 2014 23:04:24 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"WPTavern: Foster Me: A WordPress Plugin to Help Shelter Animals in Need";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=28267";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:184:"http://wptavern.com/foster-me-a-wordpress-plugin-to-help-shelter-animals-in-need?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=foster-me-a-wordpress-plugin-to-help-shelter-animals-in-need";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5833:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/dog.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[28267]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/dog.jpg?resize=800%2C397" alt="photo credit: puck90 - cc" class="size-full wp-image-28424" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/puck90/426370372/">puck90</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p>Everybody knows that animals need homes.

Her <a href="http://www.lendingapaw.org/" target="_blank">Lending a Paw</a> site features open source plugins and graphics for animal rescue organizations.</p>\n<p>Foster Me makes it easy to list and manage animals in WordPress where they can be searched with advanced pet-specific filters, such as age, type, gender, temperament, special needs, etc.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/foster-me.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[28267]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/foster-me.jpg?resize=1025%2C792" alt="foster-me" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28392" /></a></p>\n<p>When a visitor clicks on an available pet, the listing launches in a modal window.

If you already have your shelter or rescue pets listed on Petfinder, then this alternative will be a better option for automatically pulling in your existing listings.</p>\n<h3>Saving Animals with WordPress</h3>\n<p>The <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/foster-me-seek-shelter-an-animal-in-need/" target="_blank">Foster Me</a> plugin is an awesome open source tool that any shelter or rescue can use for free in combination with an existing WordPress site. When it comes to helping animals find their forever homes, open source software may not be the first thing that comes to mind, but Stephanie Chow is knocking it out of the park with her user-friendly tools designed to serve people who are rescuing creatures in need. Open source tools are more accessible to shelters and rescues that are spending every last dime to help animals find homes. If you have WordPress skills and are able to hook up a shelter with a website, then the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/foster-me-seek-shelter-an-animal-in-need/" target="_blank">Foster Me</a> plugin will put you well on your way.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 14 Aug 2014 20:57:39 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"WPTavern: WebDevStudios Names Dre Armeda Vice President of Operations";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=28328";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:182:"http://wptavern.com/webdevstudios-names-dre-armeda-vice-president-of-operations?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=webdevstudios-names-dre-armeda-vice-president-of-operations";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6086:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DreArmedaBradWilliamsFeaturedImage.png" rel="prettyphoto[28328]"><img class="size-full wp-image-28375" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DreArmedaBradWilliamsFeaturedImage.png?resize=650%2C200" alt="Dre Armeda and Brad Williams Join Forces Featured Image" /></a>Dre Armeda and Brad Williams Join Forces\n<p>In the time Dre Armeda spent with <a title="https://sucuri.net/" href="https://sucuri.net/">Sucuri</a>, he turned a two-person part-time hobby into a multi-million dollar, 30+ employee company. When Armeda <a title="http://dremeda.com/fair-winds-and-following-seas-sucuri/" href="http://dremeda.com/fair-winds-and-following-seas-sucuri/">left the company</a> he helped found, he didn&#8217;t provide any hints as to where he was going.</p>\n<p>Three months after leaving Sucuri, Armeda <a title="http://webdevstudios.com/2014/08/14/dre-armeda-joins-webdevstudios/" href="http://webdevstudios.com/2014/08/14/dre-armeda-joins-webdevstudios/">has been named</a> the Vice President of Operations for <a title="http://webdevstudios.com/" href="http://webdevstudios.com/">WebDevStudios</a>. Brad Williams, co-owner of WebDevStudios and Armeda were kind enough to answer a few questions I had regarding the hire.</p>\n<h2>Interview With Dre Armeda and Brad Williams</h2>\n<p><strong>What does the Vice President of Operations for WebDevStudios do?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Brad Williams</em> &#8211; The Vice President of Operations is a new role at WDS and our first Executive position outside of the original Partners.  WDS has been growing quite a bit this year and we knew it was time to start expanding the leadership team. Dre brings a wealth of knowledge and a ton of experience to WDS, specifically around building a very successful distributed company.  Some of the primary responsibilities for Dre include business development, improving operational efficiency, marketing, and even sales.  Roles at WDS are always evolving, so I certainly expect Dre&#8217;s position to really evolve and be defined over the next few months.</p>\n<p><strong>In some instances, businesses can ruin friendships. How did you two factor that into the equation before making the hire? Will the fact that you&#8217;re now co-workers have an effect on your personal relationship?</strong></p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DreandBrad.png" rel="prettyphoto[28328]"><img class="size-full wp-image-28378" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DreandBrad.png?resize=698%2C353" alt="Dre and Brad at WCSF 2013" /></a>Image Courtesy Of <a title="http://designsimply.com/2013/08/25/photos-from-wcsf-2013/mcm_8499/" href="http://designsimply.com/2013/08/25/photos-from-wcsf-2013/mcm_8499/">Designsimply.com</a>\n<p><em>Brad Williams</em> &#8211; When we started discussing the possibility of Dre Armeda joining WDS, this was the first item we discussed. We knew from the start that we had to look at this from a business perspective and not because we are close friends. The last thing either of us would ever want would be to ruin the friendship that we have. Dre Armeda is a perfect fit for WDS, not only in the business sense, but also our company culture. We work hard, and play hard, and no one works and plays harder than Dre Armeda!</p>\n<p><strong>Out of all the possible places to work in the WordPress ecosystem, why did you choose WebDevStudios?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Dre Armeda</em> &#8211; There is certainly a long relationship there with the leadership, the company, and the team. Brad Williams and I of course are the co-hosts of <a title="http://dradcast.com/" href="http://dradcast.com/">DradCast</a> and have even presented on the topic of security together in years past at WordCamps. While part of Sucuri, we successfully worked with WebDevstudios in various capacities. The direction of the company, and the culture is very much inline with where I want to be, and where I want to go. Along with that connection, our long relationship, and the experience I can bring to the table, I think the decision was easy.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you look at this as a long-term (2-3 year) position?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Dre Armeda</em> &#8211; One of the key points we talked about as we started looking into the possibility of working together was exactly that. We were looking for a long term situation and we’re excited about what the future brings!</p>\n<p><strong>What lessons or experiences did you learn with Sucuri that you&#8217;ll be able to apply to improve WebDevStudios?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Dre Armeda</em> &#8211; The position will encompass a broad range of responsibilities and oversight ranging from organizational and business development, to talent development and strategy. I&#8217;ve had the great opportunity to work in these areas over the past five years as I helped build Sucuri into the successful organization it is today.</p>\n<p>I am very passionate about better serving our audience by expanding global reach and I’m certainly excited about increasing overall organizational efficiency through resourcing, process improvement, and business development. I really enjoy helping implement strategies to scale organizations efficiently and ultimately the lessons I have learned from my experience at Sucuri definitely align with the forward vision at WebDevStudios!</p>\n<h2>What Was Once A Joke Has Become A Reality</h2>\n<p>Those who know Williams and Armeda have joked that the two would some day work together but it was always a joke. Now, it&#8217;s real and it will be interesting to see how it works out. Based on the interview, Armeda is committed to the company for the long-term, something that&#8217;s not <a title="http://wptavern.com/why-company-culture-is-so-important-for-remote-wordpress-developers" href="http://wptavern.com/why-company-culture-is-so-important-for-remote-wordpress-developers">easily accomplished</a> when hiring remote workers.

George Stephanis, a member of the Jetpack development team, has <a title="http://wptavern.com/easier-way-to-enable-or-disable-jetpack-modules-with-rocketeer#comment-49494" href="http://wptavern.com/easier-way-to-enable-or-disable-jetpack-modules-with-rocketeer#comment-49494">consistently explained</a> that &#8220;Jetpack only auto-activates modules that provide enhancements without affecting the front-end layout of the site.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Earlier today, Stephanis <a title="http://stephanis.info/2014/08/13/on-jetpack-and-auto-activating-modules/" href="http://stephanis.info/2014/08/13/on-jetpack-and-auto-activating-modules/">published a post on his blog</a> that goes into detail on how the decision is made to auto-activate a module.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We’ve spoken to many, many users who find a default feature set convenient, and resent having to make a bunch of ‘decision points’ if they had to manually activate each and every module. Good software should run well <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/#box">out of the box</a>. So we’ve set up the defaults as we have. Yes, <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/#minority">some people disagree and are vocal about not wanting anything to auto-activate</a>. That’s okay. We try to <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/#majority">design for the majority</a>, with the best user experience we can provide.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I appreciate the fact that new modules <strong>will not</strong> auto-activate if they impact the front end of my site. In this instance, the decisions being made for me are a convenience, not a hassle. If you disagree with the decisions being made, there are <a title="http://jeremy.hu/customize-the-list-of-modules-available-in-jetpack/" href="http://jeremy.hu/customize-the-list-of-modules-available-in-jetpack/">several filters</a> you can use to customize the Jetpack experience, including one to deactivate all modules by default.</p>\n<p><code>add_filter( \'jetpack_get_default_modules\', \'__return_empty_array\' );</code></p>\n<p>I doubt his post will resonate with those who have a strong stance against auto-activating anything.

Today, the app&#8217;s developer, Stuart Starr, announced what is perhaps the most convenient feature to date.</p>\n<p>With <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wpcore/" target="_blank">WPCore Plugin Manager</a> installed, users can now export all of their plugins with one click and save them to a new collection on WPcore.com. This is useful if you have a site that already has all the plugins you want to include in a specific collection.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/export.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[28318]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/export.jpg?resize=513%2C211" alt="export" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28336" /></a></p>\n<p>Despite the fact that the plugin makes it convenient to install all your favorite plugins in one click, you may find that building collections requires quite a bit of work. The new export feature makes it possible to build a collection instantly, based on an existing site&#8217;s active plugins. Currently, it can only export active plugins hosted on WordPress.org, but Starr plans to expand the feature in the future.</p>\n<h3>Clone WordPress Plugin Collections</h3>\n<p>Another new feature that you&#8217;ll find on the app side of WPCore is the ability to clone other users&#8217; collections. Perhaps you want most of the plugins in one collection but want to add or remove a few selections. Click on the new clone button to copy the collection to your own account for editing.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/clone-collection.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[28318]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/clone-collection.jpg?resize=983%2C518" alt="clone-collection" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28345" /></a></p>\n<p>Starr is continuing development on the app and plugin, inspired by positive feedback from users who are saving time with WPCore. &#8220;The feedback has been amazing. In terms of users we are getting new users daily,&#8221; he said. One satisfied fan dubbed WPCore the &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/kierstenbogush/status/498723752721391617" target="_blank">Pinterest for WordPress plugins</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>September will bring a major update to the service. Starr wouldn&#8217;t comment on the specifics of features on the way but he did reveal that he is currently working on a referral system. <a href="http://wptavern.com/wpcore-plugin-manager-adds-update-notifications-plans-to-implement-pro-subscription" target="_blank">WPCore is moving to a paid subscription model</a> as of August 31st but users who sign up before that time will be grandfathered in as Pro members for life.

Many plugins use language-specific shortcodes to surround embedded code, but this generally requires you to remember the right way to form the shortcode. The new <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-rainbow-hilite/" target="_blank">WordPress Rainbow Hilite</a> plugin uses a different method for embedding code in posts.</p>\n<p>The plugin incorporates the lightweight <a href="http://craig.is/making/rainbows" target="_blank">Rainbow.js</a> syntax highlighting library into WordPress and is completely themable via CSS. Rainbow Hilite utilizes the visual editor to add language-specific styles to pre tags.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rainbow-hilite-editor.png" rel="prettyphoto[28270]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rainbow-hilite-editor.png?resize=653%2C526" alt="rainbow-hilite-editor" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28284" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin includes support for 18 commonly used languages, which can be enabled or disabled in the settings located in the Writing panel:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rainbow-languages.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[28270]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rainbow-languages.jpg?resize=977%2C310" alt="rainbow-languages" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28274" /></a></p>\n<p>It also includes 19 preset visual themes to choose from for making your code beautiful. The settings panel allows you to toggle a sample code block in order to conveniently preview each theme without having to navigate to the frontend.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/toggle-code.gif" rel="prettyphoto[28270]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/toggle-code.gif?resize=850%2C504" alt="toggle-code" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28276" /></a></p>\n<p>Below is an example of how code appears on the frontend using the plugin&#8217;s sample code. One handy thing Rainbow Hilite&#8217;s output is that the highlighted code can be copy-pasted directly out of the site. There&#8217;s no &#8220;view raw&#8221; button to clutter up the code snippet.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rainbow-example.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[28270]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rainbow-example.jpg?resize=652%2C568" alt="rainbow-example" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28275" /></a></p>\n<p>Line numbers are optional and when active they are added using <a href="https://github.com/Sjeiti/rainbow.linenumbers" target="_blank">rainbow.linenumbers</a>. The plugin also includes some <a href="https://github.com/mcguffin/wp-rainbow-hilite#plugin-api" target="_blank">filters</a>, which allow users to load their own language modules and themes and plugins to hook in.</p>\n<p>If you ever decide to stop using the plugin, pre tags aren&#8217;t as bad as orphaned shortcodes littered throughout your posts. In other words, using it doesn&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;re married to the plugin for life. If you&#8217;d like to suggest any changes, the development version of Rainbow Hilite is available on <a href="https://github.com/mcguffin/wp-rainbow-hilite" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

This striking minimalist portfolio theme was created with designers, photographers, and artists in mind.</p>\n<p>Espied utilizes WordPress.com&#8217;s <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/portfolios/" target="_blank">portfolio</a> feature, which was recently <a href="http://wptavern.com/jetpack-rebrands-with-new-logo-adds-custom-post-types-in-3-1-release" target="_blank">added to Jetpack</a>.

Featured image ratio options include landscape (4:3), portrait (3:4), and square (1:1). This setting carries over to archive pages, the portfolio page template, and portfolio shortcodes.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/espied-archive-page.png" rel="prettyphoto[28131]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/espied-archive-page.png?resize=1025%2C780" alt="espied-archive-page" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28247" /></a></p>\n<p>The theme includes a sidebar that slides out to display navigation and widgets.

Add your social URLs as menu items and the theme will automatically display the right icon, if it&#8217;s available. It currently includes 22 different icons for various social profiles.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/social-links.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[28131]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/social-links.jpg?resize=660%2C305" alt="social-links" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28249" /></a></p>\n<p>Espied showcases images at full width on larger displays so it&#8217;s important to use images that are at least 1272px. Although the theme does include beautiful, readable typography for blogging, the design is probably best-suited for sites that are primarily portfolios or other visual showcases.

I’ve tried to make something that makes all the requirements easier to understand.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Theme Checklist is not meant to be a replacement for the <a title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/">Theme Check</a> plugin. Instead, it&#8217;s a collection of the most common snag points witnessed by Priday in the theme review queue. According to Priday, the queue has a five-week backlog. He hopes Theme Checklist helps decrease the queue and gets more theme developers to pass the initial review.</p>\n<p>I understand why the theme review guidelines need to be thorough and specific. It&#8217;s the WordPress.org theme directory and they help create a consistent user experience. Plugins like Theme Checklist provide an alternative learning experience to accomplish the same goal. However, it has to remain on par with the official guidelines or else it could end up doing more harm than good.</p>\n<p>Theme developers, is this a tool you see yourself using?

In particular, these devs are talking about apps that require larger development efforts &#8211; they want to charge more than &#8220;impulse purchase&#8221; prices for these, and thus want trials, upgrade pricing, etc. to support that model. They want things to work they way they always have &#8211; I don&#8217;t blame them.</p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s worth considering who wins in this &#8220;race to the bottom&#8221;. In general, more stuff for free benefits consumers, which in turn benefits the platform.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But wait!&#8221; the developers cry. &#8220;When the platform doesn&#8217;t support building more sophisticated apps, the consumers ultimately lose!&#8221; I know this argument, I&#8217;ve made it myself regarding the WordPress ecosystem. I was wrong.</p>\n<p>Consumers have been well trained that they can expect incredible value for free. Sure, they may trade off their privacy and be subjected to ads, but they aren&#8217;t asked to fork over their cash directly.</p>\n<p>VC-backed companies often contribute to the problem as well. As they clamor for users to their platforms, they give everything away &#8211; it&#8217;s so easy to flip the switch in the future and start the money pouring in. Or if that doesn&#8217;t work, they fold up shop and call it a day. Oops!</p>\n<p>More complex apps <em>will get made</em>. They just won&#8217;t be built using the model that indie developers are used to.</p>\n<p>There will be apps supported by alternative revenue streams. Some might have ads or sponsorships, some might mine and sell the data they produce, some (like Evernote and Dropbox) will be a gateway to a commercial service. People will figure out ways to get money out of a large enough user base, and apps will get built.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen this happen in the WordPress ecosystem already.

WordPress developer <a href="http://dancameron.org/" target="_blank">Daniel Cameron</a> is behind the project, which is centered around creating plugins that help business owners work more efficiently with WordPress. Sprout Apps aims to bring tasks like invoicing, estimates, and client tracking into the admin.</p>\n<p>Cameron is the creator of <a href="http://smartecart.com/" target="_blank">Smart eCart</a>, a popular solution for daily deals, crowdfunding and social commerce. For five years he has supported and maintained the plugin, which was originally created for a client project. With the desire to venture out and create something new, Cameron has soft-launched Sprout Apps, starting with <a href="https://sproutapps.co/sprout-invoices/" target="_blank">Sprout Invoices</a>, now available for purchase.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sprout-apps-invoices.png" rel="prettyphoto[28141]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sprout-apps-invoices.png?resize=500%2C387" alt="sprout-apps-invoices" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-28154" /></a></p>\n<p>Sprout Invoicing is an idea that Cameron had cooked up year ago but was hesitant about, due to the fact that other plugin developers had explored it without much success.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I went back to my original idea that I had years ago, which was a new invoicing app that solved all the problems I’ve had with Freshbooks and Harvest,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I knew there were already plugins out there which made me reluctant to pursue it further, regardless if their approach was wrong in my opinion.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Sprout Invoicing Aims to Help Streamline and Brand All Client Communications</h3>\n<p>In order to sell his product, Cameron will have to convince business owners of the value in using a WordPress-powered invoicing system instead of the many standalone services. He&#8217;s counting on customers&#8217; desire to <a href="https://sproutapps.co/news/what-sprout-invoices-solves-for-freelancers-and-wordpress-sites/" target="_blank">streamline all aspects of their businesses</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Those other standalone services are silo’d, expensive, limiting and offer limited customization for brand integrity,&#8221; Cameron contends. &#8220;I want to streamline the estimate and invoicing process. Integrating it within the site that already has the estimate request (contact form) helps tremendously.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to fully automating estimating and invoicing, the app is designed to help business owners overcome the branding limitations of popular invoicing services, which generally only let you upload a logo to a subdomain. The freedom to fully brand all client communications is a big win for small businesses.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sprout Invoice notification emails are sent from your server and your from address,&#8221; Cameron said. &#8220;No more http://yoursite.harvestbooks.com with a &#8216;Powered by A Service I Pay For&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The invoicing app is built with business owner&#8217;s needs in mind. It&#8217;s packed full of dashboards and charts, summaries, and dynamic reporting that can be easily sorted and filtered in the WordPress admin.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sprout-invoicing-charts.gif" rel="prettyphoto[28141]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sprout-invoicing-charts.gif?resize=606%2C342" alt="sprout-invoicing-charts" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28159" /></a></p>\n<p>Under the hood, Sprout Invoices is a WordPress plugin that uses custom post types, post meta and taxonomies for its data structure. &#8220;There are no additional tables created. The entire code base adheres to WordPress coding practices,&#8221; Cameron told the Tavern. &#8220;There&#8217;s hundreds of hooks and filters in SI, I want the entire app to be customizable and I anticipate it’s users to want more control than traditional WP users.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The apps he <a href="https://sproutapps.co/coming-soon/" target="_blank">plans to build</a> are actually WordPress plugins, though he felt that apps was a more applicable term. &#8220;I didn’t want to go with &#8216;Sprout plugins,&#8217; for example, because I do have ideas that aren&#8217;t plugins and I didn&#8217;t want to box myself in,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I also think &#8216;Apps&#8217; is a better term for these larger premium plugins since they offer more than a traditional plugin that might filter post content.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sprout&#8217;s next app will be a CRM, followed by a team-based app. Cameron is also considering a PM app and a time tracker, depending on how sales go with the invoicing app. <a href="https://sproutapps.co/sprout-invoices/purchase/" target="_blank">Pricing</a> for Sprouts Invoicing is similar to that of popular invoicing services, with both monthly and yearly subscription rates at $5 and $9 respectively. Subscribers will receive updates, support and <a href="https://sproutapps.co/marketplace/" target="_blank">add-on</a> discounts. Cameron also plans to launch a free version of the invoicing app later this year.</p>\n<p>Sprout Apps is built on the bold premise that your WordPress site can be more than just the marketing face of your business. It can also power the daily tasks of estimating work, billing clients, and charting progress. Cameron is aiming to provide all the business essentials with the added benefit of brand independence, a streamlined workflow, and total control. He&#8217;s got a big vision to create a superior suite of apps that will support the many freelancers and small businesses that make up a large segment of the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n<p><a href="https://sproutapps.co/" target="_blank">Sprout Apps</a> is currently in pre-launch mode and will officially launch at <a href="http://2014.la.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">WordCamp LA</a> in early September. A <a href="https://sproutapps.co/demos/" target="_blank">live demo</a> of the app is available to preview and pre-launch subscribers will receive a discount at purchase.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 12 Aug 2014 20:54:38 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"WPTavern: WP Site Care Acquires Audit WP";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=28140";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:124:"http://wptavern.com/wp-site-care-acquires-audit-wp?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wp-site-care-acquires-audit-wp";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1996:"<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/MergeFeaturedImage.png" rel="prettyphoto[28140]"><img class="size-full wp-image-28143" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/MergeFeaturedImage.png?resize=678%2C252" alt="Merge Featured Image" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rutlo/3743291132/">rutlo</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p><a title="http://auditwp.com/" href="http://auditwp.com/">Audit WP</a> has been acquired by <a title="http://www.wpsitecare.com" href="http://www.wpsitecare.com">WP Site Care</a>.

Started by <a href="https://twitter.com/rob_neu">Rob Neu</a> and <a href="http://jacobking.com">Jacob King</a>, the site launched in February, and <a href="http://www.wpsitecare.com/rob-neu-auditwp-join-wp-site-care/">today it&#8217;s been acquired by WP Site Care</a>.</p>\n<p>They made an early splash after their launch when Jacob <a href="http://auditwp.com/wp-engine-seo-failboat/">wrote a provocative post</a> about WP Engine&#8217;s SEO policies. Aside from that, they set out to productize technical SEO and general website strategy.</p>\n<p>Their product was fairly successful, but they learned a valuable lesson; they were limiting their consulting opportunities for larger contracts by productizing &#8212; and therefore bracketing themselves at a relatively low price &#8212; their entry level services. That said, the product was quite good, and will now be part of WP Site Care&#8217;s offering in the form of a la carte SEO consulting, reports, and tools.</p>\n<p>I had a call with Rob and Jacob a couple of months ago to demo their product, and because I needed real help from them. I&#8217;d been getting clobbered by Google, and they helped me identify some of the reasons why and set about a plan to fix it. I&#8217;m still working on it, and was very pleased with what they offered.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7079" src="http://www.poststat.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/audit-wp-overview-752x488.jpg" alt="audit-wp-overview" width="627" height="406" /></p>\n<p>This and other tools were quite nice, and the value I got from a short call and report were pretty enormous. I think this will be a compelling product for WP Site Care&#8217;s services, and it will fit in well with their other offerings.</p>\n<p>If you know Rob Neu and WP Site Care&#8217;s owner, Ryan Sullivan, then you already know they are friends. Rob joining WP Site Care doesn&#8217;t come as a shock, and seems to make sense all around. The two are already working on a separate side project together, called <a href="http://flagshipwp.com/">Flagship</a>, a theme company. Additionally, WP Site Care was a sponsor and often attendee on WP Bacon, Rob&#8217;s old podcast that also unfortunately bit the dust.</p>\n<p>Rob and Ryan&#8217;s partnership for Flagship will remain separate, and Rob will be the Director of Digital Strategy for WP Site Care, now a team of five full time employees. Rob is a technical guy, and in addition to running strategy and marketing for WP Site Care, he&#8217;ll be working on refining some of their product offerings as well.</p>\n<h3>What is WP Site Care anyway?</h3>\n<p>I talked about WP Site Care and other <a title="The rise of WordPress maintenance services" href="http://www.poststat.us/rise-wordpress-maintenance-services/">WordPress maintenance services</a> earlier this year.

With all that work invested, admins are looking for new ways to make comment interaction more valuable to those who are participating.</p>\n<p>WordPress.com recently<a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2014/08/07/introducing-comment-likes/" target="_blank"> added comment likes</a> to the delight of its users. Self-hosted WordPress site admins are hopeful that comment likes will find their way into Jetpack as well. If you&#8217;re interested in doing something more with comments, there are many plugins that help to promote interaction on your site.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/comment-popularity/" target="_blank">Comment Popularity</a> is a new one that caught my eye. The plugin, created by <a href="https://twitter.com/paul_wp" target="_blank">Paul de Wouters</a> and his colleagues at <a href="http://hmn.md/" target="_blank">Human Made</a>, adds Reddit style commenting to WordPress. Registered site members can vote comments up or down to increase or decrease comment visibility.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/comment-popularity.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[28045]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/comment-popularity.jpg?resize=785%2C613" alt="comment-popularity" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28093" /></a></p>\n<p>When the plugin is active, comments are sorted by weight (number of votes) in a descending order. Site members receive karma each time one of their comments is upvoted. Administrators have the option to attribute more weight to &#8220;expert&#8221; commenters by adding an expert label and additional points on user profiles.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/user-profile-comment-popularity-settings.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[28045]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/user-profile-comment-popularity-settings.jpg?resize=503%2C234" alt="user-profile-comment-popularity-settings" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28102" /></a></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also an option in the discussion panel for setting a default expert karma.</p>\n<p>De Wouters and the folks at Human Made plan to support and maintain the plugin via the forums on WordPress.org. It was originally created for their client, CFO Publishing, who will be listed as a contributor on the next release.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;I have a few ideas for integration with other plugins such as Stream, and our SaaS product WP Remote,&#8221;</strong> de Wouters said. I asked if he plans to add a UI for showing users their aggregate upvotes/ranks, and he confirmed that this is a possibility. &#8220;We&#8217;re already storing users voting activity, so it makes sense to offer an admin view for it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Maybe a dashboard widget. Also, this is the kind of data we&#8217;d send to WP Remote or Stream.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The plugin is currently restricted to registered users, as it doesn&#8217;t make much sense to leave it open for anonymous users to vote. &#8220;I do however plan to develop a drop in class that will allow users to authenticate themselves via social networks, which will reduce friction and still provide a way to identify a user with relative reliabilty,&#8221; de Wouters commented regarding future development plans. Although he wants to keep it simple and focused on one particular functionality, he is open to suggestions and contributions via the plugin&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/humanmade/comment-popularity" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n<p>Comment Popularity gives registered users a way to weigh in on discussions without having to comment. Consequently, there is a greater incentive for readers to register for your site. It gives everyone a chance to influence the conversation. As users attribute value to comments they like, the best comments will float to the top. This saves readers from having to scroll through all the mediocre comments in order to find the highest quality responses.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a new way to encourage interaction in your comments, the Comment Popularity plugin is simple and intuitive to use. It should work automatically with most standard comment forms. <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/comment-popularity/" target="_blank">Download</a> the plugin for free from WordPress.org and watch the GitHub repository for updates in development.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 12 Aug 2014 00:14:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"WPTavern: Interview With Siobhan McKeown On The Future Of The WordPress Codex";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=28089";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:198:"http://wptavern.com/interview-with-siobhan-mckeown-on-the-future-of-the-wordpress-codex?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=interview-with-siobhan-mckeown-on-the-future-of-the-wordpress-codex";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6798:"<p>If you use WordPress, chances are that you&#8217;ve run into the <a title="http://codex.wordpress.org/" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/">WordPress Codex</a>. The Codex is a community maintained collection of documentation, hooks, filters, best practices, and other information related to WordPress. With various <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/projects/handbooks/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/projects/handbooks/">handbook projects</a> underway, I&#8217;ve been wondering what the future of the Codex is. To find out, I got in touch with <a title="http://siobhanmckeown.com/" href="http://siobhanmckeown.com/">Siobhan McKeown</a>, who is a member of the <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/">documentation team</a>.</p>\n<h2>Interview With Siobhan McKeown</h2>\n<p><strong>Is the <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/2013/06/19/docs-sprint-results-and-roadmap/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/2013/06/19/docs-sprint-results-and-roadmap/">roadmap outlined here</a> still accurate and is it being followed? Is it still on time?</strong></p>\n<p>The roadmap is still fairly accurate but it’s not on time. The number of contributors to docs is quite small and we’ve faced challenges around getting development work done and finding people to write. That said, the people who are involved are very dedicated and we’re slowly chipping away at things. We have made big strides forward, particularly in the area of inline docs (thanks <a title="http://profiles.wordpress.org/drewapicture" href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/drewapicture">Drew Jaynes</a> and <a title="https://profiles.wordpress.org/kpdesign" href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/kpdesign">Kim Parsell</a>) and in building <a title="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/" href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/">developer.wordpress.org</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Ultimately, is the future of the Codex for it to disappear in favor of all the other documentation resources outlined in the roadmap?</strong></p>\n<p>I would like for that to happen, but the decision doesn’t ultimately lie with me and it’s a discussion that we’ll have to return to once new documentation is in place.</p>\n<p>Many free software projects in the early stages of their life use a wiki for their documentation. Over time, this can become out-of-date and inaccurate. As a project grows, it often out-grows a wiki, requiring more targeted documentation for both users and developers. <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/products/firefox">Firefox</a> and <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">Ruby on Rails</a> are good examples of FOSS projects that provide the types of targeted documentation that WordPress should be providing. I would hope that we can eventually get there ourselves, and keep the Codex as a historical archive.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/MozillaFireFoxTargetedSupport.png" rel="prettyphoto[28089]"><img class="size-full wp-image-28100" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/MozillaFireFoxTargetedSupport.png?resize=966%2C690" alt="Mozilla FireFox Targeted Documentation" /></a>Mozilla FireFox Targeted Documentation\n<p><strong>Is it a waste of effort and energy for folks to continue to edit and update the Codex?</strong></p>\n<p>No. For two reasons: First of all, while all of the docs work is going on, we need to ensure that the Codex stays up-to-date and accurate. It remains WordPress’ primary source of documentation and will be for some time, so contributions are still valuable there. When a new version of WordPress is released, the docs team usually does a sprint to get the Codex up-to-date.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the main problem with the Codex is its navigation and structure. There’s a lot of good content in there mixed with a lot of out-of-date content. As we create new resources, we look at the content in the Codex and migrate good-quality content. If you fix a page in the Codex, then it’s likely that will end up somewhere in a new documentation resource.</p>\n<p><strong>How can folks get involved with helping the roadmap move along?</strong></p>\n<p>We particularly need help in two areas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Someone to help with ongoing development of <a title="http://wptavern.com/help-contribute-to-the-official-wordpress-developer-resource-by-testing-code-references" href="http://wptavern.com/help-contribute-to-the-official-wordpress-developer-resource-by-testing-code-references">WP-Parser</a> (the parser used to generate the Code Reference). A lot of things are on hold until we get someone helping there.</li>\n<li>Writing the <a title="https://make.wordpress.org/docs/theme-developer-handbook/" href="https://make.wordpress.org/docs/theme-developer-handbook/">theme</a> and <a title="https://make.wordpress.org/docs/plugin-developer-handbook/" href="https://make.wordpress.org/docs/plugin-developer-handbook/">plugin developer</a> handbooks. These have been around for a long time and we really want to get them finished off so that we can move on to focusing on user support.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>To Some, Google Is The WordPress Codex</h2>\n<p>It may be the largest collection of WordPress documentation but I bet it doesn&#8217;t compare to the amount of WordPress content published on sites across the web. The paradox of publishing content on the Codex for the benefit of everyone versus a personal site for the benefit of a small audience has existed since it was created.</p>\n<p>I think it would be awesome if content from sites like <a title="http://justintadlock.com/" href="http://justintadlock.com/">Justin Tadlock</a> found a home on the Codex but perhaps we don&#8217;t need one at all. Maybe all we need is Google. When I asked the Tavern&#8217;s Twitter followers what <a title="http://wptavern.com/7-aspects-of-wordpress-i-take-for-granted" href="http://wptavern.com/7-aspects-of-wordpress-i-take-for-granted">aspect of WordPress do they take for granted</a>, Jared Novack submitted the following answer:</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/wptavern">@wptavern</a> You can type anything into google followed by "WordPress" and someone has already asked (and answered) it</p>\n<p>&mdash; Jared Novack (@jaredNova) <a href="https://twitter.com/jaredNova/statuses/494322903739936768">July 30, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>If the Codex ever goes offline, it will be a sad day. However, if it&#8217;s replaced with easy to navigate, skill level targeted documentation, with a solid code reference, I think a lot of users and developers will be happy with its replacement. Has the Codex saved your bacon once or twice?

(1, 1, '2014-06-16 16:07:20', '2014-06-16 16:07:20', 'Okay, so you\'ve done your market research (hopefully), put together an plan, cooked up your ground-breaking idea, and you are ready to build your website or app so you can get this show on the road. Also you know that you don\'t want to spend months or years learning how to code, so you\'ve decided to leverage the talents of a developer.\r\n\r\nYou can\'t quite afford the hot-shot developers at the agency downtown so you instinctually go to Craigslist or Elance and begin your search for the "right" freelance developer. You might even ask some friends for some contacts. You find someone who seems good enough and has a "great" rate. Hooray! You\'re good to go. You send the guy the deposit funds to start and the anticipation of the glorious outcome continues to build.\r\n<h3>The Aftermath</h3>\r\nSix months and thousands of dollars later, you still have no product to ship. Or if you do, the product is so buggy and expensive to maintain that your baby business is already fading fast. You\'re getting words like API, SQL, SSL, Gem, UX, SEO, Validation, Backend, Frontend, Analytics and CMS thrown at you. But you are totally in the dark about what\'s going on or what your contractor is actually doing. You\'re getting surprise invoices left and right for thousands of dollars. You have very few customers, if any, and the one\'s you do have are very unhappy. You\'re grand idea that was supposed to make you a fortune (or at least a living) is now an endless nightmare hobby that has sucked all the passion (and money) from you.\r\n\r\nYou now ask yourself, "Did I hire the right guy to do this?". It would seem like the catastrophe happened either because your idea was bad or because it was executed poorly by your developer. The self-centeredness in us all goes right to the developer as the scapegoat. "It\'s definitely their fault" (Even though the odds are your idea had some holes in it too). But the truth is, whether you blame your idea or your hired gun (or both), this all could\'ve been avoided by you. You already know this, but I\'ll say it anyway. You are ultimately responsible for the success of your product. That\'s the good and bad side of being in business. Sobering but true.\r\n<h3>Picking up the pieces</h3>\r\nThere\'s no way around it. Failing sucks. But what sucks more is failing and not being able to pin-point exactly why you failed. Or what to do next time to prevent failing the same way. Fact is, you could start over with a different developer and end up with the same result. FML. If insanity is doing the same thing over and over but expecting a different result, then you are riding the crazy train. In the end it feels more like a curse than a single unfortunate event. But it\'s time to take a stand.\r\n\r\nIs this you? Have you already been through a few developers on a few different projects with no success? Have developers and freelancers left a bad taste in your mouth? Never know what to expect? Always getting surprise bills for way more than you thought? Are you about to give up on your dream and write your ambitions off like everyone else?\r\n<h3>How it should be</h3>\r\nImagine it is simple to launch your product quickly and on budget. You are launching your app without a hitch, minimal bugs, and bringing joy to your customers. You are making a profit quickly, instead of waiting years to recoup your investment. You love working with your developer because she is an invaluable asset to your business. No "surprise invoices". She fills you in on exactly what is going on. Most of all, imagine it was easy to find her because you knew where to look, what signs to look for and how to hire her the right way. Is this world possible? Or is this person more like a unicorn?\r\n<h3>The secret</h3>\r\nWell, it turns out that hiring a great developer is not a pipe dream. The secret is that it takes a good coder to hire a good coder. In other words, pay an expensive "rockstar" coder to help you vet a developer for your project.\r\nThink about it. You don\'t know where to find quality developers. You don\'t know what good or bad code looks like. You don\'t know what traits and practices reveal a good developer or a bad one. You aren\'t sure which skills they need to have, i.e. design, frontend, backend, etc, etc. You don\'t know how to prove that they have the skills they say they do. Freelancers can just throw words and acronyms at you to impress you and get the sale (I\'ve seen it). You aren\'t even sure which platform to use, and hence what type of developer you\'ll need. There are so many unknowns in this situation, I can\'t even list them all. Why not leverage the brain of someone who understands this world. Even if it costs you a pretty penny to buy a couple session hours, it will be well worth it in the long run.\r\n\r\nFamous (or internet famous) developers are everywhere shipping products and living your dream. You can\'t justify hiring one of those guys at hundreds of dollars per hour for an entire project, but you could swing hiring them for one or two hours to help get you going in the right direction. Even if you pay a few hundred dollars for an hour of their time, this could save you thousands of dollars and potentially years of wasted time.\r\nWhere do you start?\r\n\r\nDo this. Find a "rockstar" developer on the web who you know without a doubt is an expert and developing things similar to your product. This is who you would hire to build your product if money was no object. But remember, you\'re just hiring her for 2 hours. Her hourly rate will be expensive. Email her and then try calling her up. Pay for an hour long session before you look for candidates to get an idea of who you want to find. Then pay her for another session again after you have at least 5 candidates and are ready to pull the trigger.\r\n\r\nI could (and should) write a whole book on this, but here is a quick run-down of what to do.\r\n<h4>1. Prepare: Get your stuff together</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Do market research online to make sure your idea is worth pursuing and there are people ready to buy your product</li>\r\n	<li>Make rough sketches of your product</li>\r\n	<li>Figure out the budget for your product</li>\r\n	<li>Figure out a rough timeline</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>2. First Session: Questions</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>What skills should my developer have to do this project?</li>\r\n	<li>What are the basic process needed for a project like this? (i.e. design &gt; frontend &gt; backend &gt; testing &gt; launch)</li>\r\n	<li>Which Platform/Language do you recommend for this project? i.e. Rails, Wordpress, Shopify, Magento, Objective C, Django, .NET, Java, etc. (You want to use the right platform for the project, not just whatever platform your developer happens to use)</li>\r\n	<li>For what reasons do you recommend this platform?</li>\r\n	<li>Where can I find good (insert platform) developers? Do you have a developer you would recommend?</li>\r\n	<li>Ask any questions about anything you don\'t understand. Ask as many questions as you can!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>3. Candidates: Find &amp; Interview</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Decide whether you want a remote developer or if you want to limit yourself to local</li>\r\n	<li>Find them online or from recommendation</li>\r\n	<li>Email them and request an estimate of cost &amp; time for your project. (Attach sketches)</li>\r\n	<li>Also ask to see their work (pay attention to their writing skills).</li>\r\n	<li>Call them. Ask them some questions that require an in depth response. (pay attention to their verbal communication skills)</li>\r\n	<li>Look at their GitHub.com account to see what "open source" projects they love to work on</li>\r\n	<li>Ask for references to call (I know this is old school but it works).</li>\r\n	<li>Ask references if they meet deadlines and budgets.</li>\r\n	<li>Years of experience don\'t matter</li>\r\n	<li>Don\'t be fooled by the hourly rate. It means nothing. Ask them a range of hours that it would take to complete project so you can get an idea of total cost.</li>\r\n	<li>Rule out anyone who is bad at communicating</li>\r\n	<li>Rule out anyone who is not excited to teach you about things you don\'t understand</li>\r\n	<li>Rule out anyone who you wouldn\'t enjoy interacting with a lot</li>\r\n	<li>Rule out anyone who is not passionate.</li>\r\n	<li>Narrow down to 3-5 developers</li>\r\n	<li>Meet them each in person for 30 minute interviews to get a feel for them</li>\r\n	<li>Compile all profiles, contact info, previous work, github urls, etc for each candidate, and email for your rockstar. (Make it easy to quickly move through their work and see what caliber of developer they are)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>4. Second Session: Questions</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>After viewing all candidates, which developer would be best for my project?</li>\r\n	<li>For what reasons is this developer the best choice?</li>\r\n	<li>Should I go along with _____\'s pricing and billing methods or propose a different payment structure?</li>\r\n	<li>My gut is telling me Bob, do you think he is a good pick?</li>\r\n	<li>Why or why wouldn\'t Bob be a good pick?</li>\r\n	<li>Ask every valuable question that comes to your mind.</li>\r\n	<li>It will be very clear at this point, and you will at least have it narrowed down to 1 or 2.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>5. Trial Run: Hire for pre-project</h4>\r\nNext hire the chosen developer for a mini-project. Regardless of who you pick, always do a pre-project if it\'s the first time working with someone. Take a small part of your large project and break it off into a mini-project that will have it\'s own budget and deadline. This is where the rubber meets the road and you can see if the developer is good to work with or not. Odds are if they\'ve been vetted by your rockstar it will be fine, but if not you can make your way down the list to the next best person.\r\n<h4>6. Make It Official: Hire to build your product</h4>\r\nNow that you\'ve completed the first pre-project and know that it\'s a good fit, it\'s time to dive in and get stuff done. You know that you can trust them. Your "rockstar" developer trusts them. Let\'s build this product! Sell it. Give customers what they are wanting and reap the benefits in the process.\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\nYou now have a great Ruby developer who is partnering with you on your product. She is keeping you in the know about everything and letting you know what to expect along the way. You know what her skills are and at least a little bit about everything they handle for you. You understand more than half of the acronyms now because she has been teaching you along the way. You know your using a Ruby On Rails backend platform with an API that talks to your iOS and Android app seamlessly. You also have a neutral third party who can help you decipher the state of your product when you get confused. You are able to focus on your customers now, the ones who really matter. This cohesiveness between you and your team helps your business become more profitable and helps you make better financial decisions.\r\n\r\nBut most of all, you have piece of mind because you know what is happening with your product and where you are taking this ship.', 'How to hire a developer', '', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'how-to-hire-a-developer', '', '', '2014-08-01 12:54:39', '2014-08-01 17:54:39', '', 0, 'http://dev.railsvitamins.com/?p=1', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Also you know that you don\'t want to spend months or years learning how to code, so you\'ve decided to leverage the talents of a developer.\n\nYou can\'t quite afford the hot-shot developers at the agency downtown so you instinctually go to Craigslist or Elance and begin your search for the "right" freelance developer. You might even ask some friends for some contacts. You find someone who seems good enough and has a "great" rate. Hooray! You\'re good to go. You send the guy the deposit funds to start and the anticipation of the glorious outcome continues to build.\n<h3>The Aftermath</h3>\nSix months and thousands of dollars later, you still have no product to ship. Or if you do, the product is so buggy and expensive to maintain that your baby business is already fading fast. You\'re getting words like API, SQL, SSL, Gem, UX, SEO, Validation, Backend, Frontend, Analytics and CMS thrown at you. But you are totally in the dark about what\'s going on or what your contractor is actually doing. You\'re getting surprise invoices left and right for thousands of dollars. You have very few customers, if any, and the one\'s you do have are very unhappy. You\'re grand idea that was supposed to make you a fortune (or at least a living) is now an endless nightmare hobby that has sucked all the passion (and money) from you.\n\nYou now ask yourself, "Did I hire the right guy to do this?". It would seem like the catastrophe happened either because your idea was bad or because it was executed poorly by your developer. The self-centeredness in us all goes right to the developer as the scapegoat. "It\'s definitely their fault" (Even though the odds are your idea had some holes in it too). But the truth is, whether you blame your idea or your hired gun (or both), this all could\'ve been avoided by you. You already know this, but I\'ll say it anyway. You are ultimately responsible for the success of your product. That\'s the good and bad side of being in business. Sobering but true.\n<h3>Picking up the pieces</h3>\nThere\'s no way around it. Failing sucks. But what sucks more is failing and not being able to pin-point exactly why you failed. Or what to do next time to prevent failing the same way. Fact is, you could start over with a different developer and end up with the same result. FML. If insanity is doing the same thing over and over but expecting a different result, then you are riding the crazy train. In the end it feels more like a curse than a single unfortunate event. But it\'s time to take a stand.\nIs this you? Have you already been through a few developers on a few different projects with no success? Have developers and freelancers left a bad taste in your mouth? Never know what to expect? Always getting surprise bills for way more than you thought? Are you about to give up on your dream and write your ambitions off like everyone else?\n<h3>How it should be</h3>\nImagine it is simple to launch your product quickly and on budget. You are launching your app without a hitch, minimal bugs, and bringing joy to your customers. You are making a profit quickly, instead of waiting years to recoup your investment. You love working with your developer because she is an invaluable asset to your business. No "surprise invoices". She fills you in on exactly what is going on. Most of all, imagine it was easy to find her because you knew where to look, what signs to look for and how to hire her the right way. Is this world possible? Or is this person more like a unicorn?\n<h3>The secret</h3>\nWell, it turns out that hiring a great developer is not a pipe dream. The secret is that it takes a good coder to hire a good coder. In other words, pay an expensive "rockstar" coder to help you vet a developer for your project.\nThink about it. You don\'t know where to find quality developers. You don\'t know what good or bad code looks like. You don\'t know what traits and practices reveal a good developer or a bad one. You aren\'t sure which skills they need to have, i.e. design, frontend, backend, etc, etc. You don\'t know how to prove that they have the skills they say they do. Freelancers can just throw words and acronyms at you to impress you and get the sale (I\'ve seen it). You aren\'t even sure which platform to use, and hence what type of developer you\'ll need. There are so many unknowns in this situation, I can\'t even list them all. Why not leverage the brain of someone who understands this world. Even if it costs you a pretty penny to buy a couple session hours, it will be well worth it in the long run.\n\nFamous (or internet famous) developers are everywhere shipping products and living your dream. You can\'t justify hiring one of those guys at hundreds of dollars per hour for an entire project, but you could swing hiring them for one or two hours to help get you going in the right direction. Even if you pay a few hundred dollars for an hour of their time, this could save you thousands of dollars and potentially years of wasted time.\nWhere do you start?\n\nDo this. Find a "rockstar" developer on the web who you know without a doubt is an expert and developing things similar to your product. This is who you would hire to build your product if money was no object. But remember, you\'re just hiring her for 2 hours. Her hourly rate will be expensive. Email her and then try calling her up. Pay for an hour long session before you look for candidates to get an idea of who you want to find. Then pay her for another session again after you have at least 5 candidates and are ready to pull the trigger.\n\nI could (and should) write a whole book on this, but here is a quick run-down of what to do.\n<h4>1. Prepare: Get your stuff together</h4>\n<ul>\n	<li>Do market research online to make sure your idea is worth pursuing and there are people ready to buy your product</li>\n	<li>Make rough sketches of your product</li>\n	<li>Figure out the budget for your product</li>\n	<li>Figure out a rough timeline</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. First Session: Questions</h3>\n<ul>\n	<li>What skills should my developer have to do this project?</li>\n	<li>What are the basic process needed for a project like this? (i.e. design &gt; frontend &gt; backend &gt; testing &gt; launch)</li>\n	<li>Which Platform/Language do you recommend for this project? i.e. Rails, Wordpress, Shopify, Magento, Objective C, Django, .NET, Java, etc. (You want to use the right platform for the project, not just whatever platform your developer happens to use)</li>\n	<li>For what reasons do you recommend this platform?</li>\n	<li>Where can I find good (insert platform) developers? Do you have a developer you would recommend?</li>\n	<li>Ask any questions about anything you don\'t understand. Ask as many questions as you can!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. Candidates: Find &amp; Interview</h3>\n<ul>\n	<li>Decide whether you want a remote developer or if you want to limit yourself to local</li>\n	<li>Find them online or from recommendation</li>\n	<li>Email them and request an estimate of cost &amp; time for your project. (Attach sketches)</li>\n	<li>Also ask to see their work (pay attention to their writing skills).</li>\n	<li>Call them. Ask them some questions that require an in depth response. (pay attention to their verbal communication skills)</li>\n	<li>Look at their GitHub.com account to see what "open source" projects they love to work on</li>\n	<li>Ask for references to call (I know this is old school but it works).</li>\n	<li>Ask references if they meet deadlines and budgets.</li>\n	<li>Years of experience don\'t matter</li>\n	<li>Don\'t be fooled by the hourly rate. It means nothing. Ask them a range of hours that it would take to complete project so you can get an idea of total cost.</li>\n	<li>Rule out anyone who is bad at communicating</li>\n	<li>Rule out anyone who is not excited to teach you about things you don\'t understand</li>\n	<li>Rule out anyone who you wouldn\'t enjoy interacting with a lot</li>\n	<li>Rule out anyone who is not passionate.</li>\n	<li>Narrow down to 3-5 developers</li>\n	<li>Meet them each in person for 30 minute interviews to get a feel for them</li>\n	<li>Compile all profiles, contact info, previous work, github urls, etc for each candidate, and email for your rockstar. (Make it easy to quickly move through their work and see what caliber of developer they are)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4. Second Session: Questions</h3>\n<ul>\n	<li>After viewing all candidates, which developer would be best for my project?</li>\n	<li>For what reasons is this developer the best choice?</li>\n	<li>Should I go along with _____\'s pricing and billing methods or propose a different payment structure?</li>\n	<li>My gut is telling me Bob, do you think he is a good pick?</li>\n	<li>Why or why wouldn\'t Bob be a good pick?</li>\n	<li>Ask every valuable question that comes to your mind.</li>\n	<li>It will be very clear at this point, and you will at least have it narrowed down to 1 or 2.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>5. Trial Run: Hire for pre-project</h3>\nNext hire the chosen developer for a mini-project. Regardless of who you pick, always do a pre-project if it\'s the first time working with someone. Take a small part of your large project and break it off into a mini-project that will have it\'s own budget and deadline. This is where the rubber meets the road and you can see if the developer is good to work with or not. Odds are if they\'ve been vetted by your rockstar it will be fine, but if not you can make your way down the list to the next best person.\n<h3>6. Make It Official: Hire to build your product</h3>\nNow that you\'ve completed the first pre-project and know that it\'s a good fit, it\'s time to dive in and get stuff done. You know that you can trust them. Your "rockstar" developer trusts them. Let\'s build this product! Sell it. Give customers what they are wanting and reap the benefits in the process.\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\nYou now have a great Ruby developer who is partnering with you on your product. She is keeping you in the know about everything and letting you know what to expect along the way. You know what her skills are and at least a little bit about everything they handle for you. You understand more than half of the acronyms now because she has been teaching you along the way. You know your using a Ruby On Rails backend platform with an API that talks to your iOS and Android app seamlessly. You also have a neutral third party who can help you decipher the state of your product when you get confused. You are able to focus on your customers now, the ones who really matter. This cohesiveness between you and your team helps your business become more profitable and helps you make better financial decisions.\n\nBut most of all, you have piece of mind because you know what is happening with your product and where you are taking this ship moving forward.\n\nPlease subscribe below to receive more how-to\'s on bootstrapping, development &amp; design.', 'How to hire a developer', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '1-autosave-v1', '', '', '2014-06-16 20:12:08', '2014-06-16 20:12:08', '', 1, 'http://dev.railsvitamins.com/1-autosave-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0) ;

Trial Run: Hire for pre-project</h3>\r\nNext hire the chosen developer for a mini-project. Regardless of who you pick, always do a pre-project if it\'s the first time working with someone. Take a small part of your large project and break it off into a mini-project that will have it\'s own budget and deadline. This is where the rubber meets the road and you can see if the developer is good to work with or not. Odds are if they\'ve been vetted by your rockstar it will be fine, but if not you can make your way down the list to the next best person.\r\n<h3>6. Make It Official: Hire to build your product</h3>\r\nNow that you\'ve completed the first pre-project and know that it\'s a good fit, it\'s time to dive in and get stuff done. You know that you can trust them. Your "rockstar" developer trusts them. Let\'s build this product! Sell it. Give customers what they are wanting and reap the benefits in the process.\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\nYou now have a great Ruby developer who is partnering with you on your product. She is keeping you in the know about everything and letting you know what to expect along the way. You know what her skills are and at least a little bit about everything they handle for you. You understand more than half of the acronyms now because she has been teaching you along the way. You know your using a Ruby On Rails backend platform with an API that talks to your iOS and Android app seamlessly. You also have a neutral third party who can help you decipher the state of your product when you get confused. You are able to focus on your customers now, the ones who really matter. This cohesiveness between you and your team helps your business become more profitable and helps you make better financial decisions.\r\n\r\nBut most of all, you have piece of mind because you know what is happening with your product and where you are taking this ship moving forward.\r\n\r\nPlease subscribe below to receive more how-to\'s on bootstrapping, development &amp; design.', 'How to hire a developer', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '1-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-06-16 20:11:06', '2014-06-16 20:11:06', '', 1, 'http://dev.railsvitamins.com/1-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Also you know that you don\'t want to spend months or years learning how to code, so you\'ve decided to leverage the talents of a developer.\r\n\r\nYou can\'t quite afford the hot-shot developers at the agency downtown so you instinctually go to Craigslist or Elance and begin your search for the "right" freelance developer. You might even ask some friends for some contacts. You find someone who seems good enough and has a "great" rate. Hooray! You\'re good to go. You send the guy the deposit funds to start and the anticipation of the glorious outcome continues to build.\r\n<h3>The Aftermath</h3>\r\nSix months and thousands of dollars later, you still have no product to ship. Or if you do, the product is so buggy and expensive to maintain that your baby business is already fading fast. You\'re getting words like API, SQL, SSL, Gem, UX, SEO, Validation, Backend, Frontend, Analytics and CMS thrown at you. But you are totally in the dark about what\'s going on or what your contractor is actually doing. You\'re getting surprise invoices left and right for thousands of dollars. You have very few customers, if any, and the one\'s you do have are very unhappy. You\'re grand idea that was supposed to make you a fortune (or at least a living) is now an endless nightmare hobby that has sucked all the passion (and money) from you.\r\n\r\nYou now ask yourself, "Did I hire the right guy to do this?". It would seem like the catastrophe happened either because your idea was bad or because it was executed poorly by your developer. The self-centeredness in us all goes right to the developer as the scapegoat. "It\'s definitely their fault" (Even though the odds are your idea had some holes in it too). But the truth is, whether you blame your idea or your hired gun (or both), this all could\'ve been avoided by you. You already know this, but I\'ll say it anyway. You are ultimately responsible for the success of your product. That\'s the good and bad side of being in business. Sobering but true.\r\n<h3>Picking up the pieces</h3>\r\nThere\'s no way around it. Failing sucks. But what sucks more is failing and not being able to pin-point exactly why you failed. Or what to do next time to prevent failing the same way. Fact is, you could start over with a different developer and end up with the same result. FML. If insanity is doing the same thing over and over but expecting a different result, then you are riding the crazy train. In the end it feels more like a curse than a single unfortunate event. But it\'s time to take a stand.\r\nIs this you? Have you already been through a few developers on a few different projects with no success? Have developers and freelancers left a bad taste in your mouth? Never know what to expect? Always getting surprise bills for way more than you thought? Are you about to give up on your dream and write your ambitions off like everyone else?\r\n<h3>How it should be</h3>\r\nImagine it is simple to launch your product quickly and on budget. You are launching your app without a hitch, minimal bugs, and bringing joy to your customers. You are making a profit quickly, instead of waiting years to recoup your investment. You love working with your developer because she is an invaluable asset to your business. No "surprise invoices". She fills you in on exactly what is going on. Most of all, imagine it was easy to find her because you knew where to look, what signs to look for and how to hire her the right way. Is this world possible? Or is this person more like a unicorn?\r\n<h3>The secret</h3>\r\nWell, it turns out that hiring a great developer is not a pipe dream. The secret is that it takes a good coder to hire a good coder. In other words, pay an expensive "rockstar" coder to help you vet a developer for your project.\r\nThink about it. You don\'t know where to find quality developers. You don\'t know what good or bad code looks like. You don\'t know what traits and practices reveal a good developer or a bad one. You aren\'t sure which skills they need to have, i.e. design, frontend, backend, etc, etc. You don\'t know how to prove that they have the skills they say they do. Freelancers can just throw words and acronyms at you to impress you and get the sale (I\'ve seen it). You aren\'t even sure which platform to use, and hence what type of developer you\'ll need. There are so many unknowns in this situation, I can\'t even list them all. Why not leverage the brain of someone who understands this world. Even if it costs you a pretty penny to buy a couple session hours, it will be well worth it in the long run.\r\n\r\nFamous (or internet famous) developers are everywhere shipping products and living your dream. You can\'t justify hiring one of those guys at hundreds of dollars per hour for an entire project, but you could swing hiring them for one or two hours to help get you going in the right direction. Even if you pay a few hundred dollars for an hour of their time, this could save you thousands of dollars and potentially years of wasted time.\r\nWhere do you start?\r\n\r\nDo this. Find a "rockstar" developer on the web who you know without a doubt is an expert and developing things similar to your product. This is who you would hire to build your product if money was no object. But remember, you\'re just hiring her for 2 hours. Her hourly rate will be expensive. Email her and then try calling her up. Pay for an hour long session before you look for candidates to get an idea of who you want to find. Then pay her for another session again after you have at least 5 candidates and are ready to pull the trigger.\r\n\r\nI could (and should) write a whole book on this, but here is a quick run-down of what to do.\r\n<h4>1.

Or what to do next time to prevent failing the same way. Fact is, you could start over with a different developer and end up with the same result. FML. If insanity is doing the same thing over and over but expecting a different result, then you are riding the crazy train. In the end it feels more like a curse than a single unfortunate event. But it\'s time to take a stand.\r\n\r\nIs this you? Have you already been through a few developers on a few different projects with no success? Have developers and freelancers left a bad taste in your mouth? Never know what to expect? Always getting surprise bills for way more than you thought? Are you about to give up on your dream and write your ambitions off like everyone else?\r\n<h3>How it should be</h3>\r\nImagine it is simple to launch your product quickly and on budget. You are launching your app without a hitch, minimal bugs, and bringing joy to your customers. You are making a profit quickly, instead of waiting years to recoup your investment. You love working with your developer because she is an invaluable asset to your business. No "surprise invoices". She fills you in on exactly what is going on. Most of all, imagine it was easy to find her because you knew where to look, what signs to look for and how to hire her the right way. Is this world possible? Or is this person more like a unicorn?\r\n<h3>The secret</h3>\r\nWell, it turns out that hiring a great developer is not a pipe dream. The secret is that it takes a good coder to hire a good coder. In other words, pay an expensive "rockstar" coder to help you vet a developer for your project.\r\nThink about it. You don\'t know where to find quality developers. You don\'t know what good or bad code looks like. You don\'t know what traits and practices reveal a good developer or a bad one. You aren\'t sure which skills they need to have, i.e. design, frontend, backend, etc, etc. You don\'t know how to prove that they have the skills they say they do. Freelancers can just throw words and acronyms at you to impress you and get the sale (I\'ve seen it). You aren\'t even sure which platform to use, and hence what type of developer you\'ll need. There are so many unknowns in this situation, I can\'t even list them all. Why not leverage the brain of someone who understands this world. Even if it costs you a pretty penny to buy a couple session hours, it will be well worth it in the long run.\r\n\r\nFamous (or internet famous) developers are everywhere shipping products and living your dream. You can\'t justify hiring one of those guys at hundreds of dollars per hour for an entire project, but you could swing hiring them for one or two hours to help get you going in the right direction. Even if you pay a few hundred dollars for an hour of their time, this could save you thousands of dollars and potentially years of wasted time.\r\nWhere do you start?\r\n\r\nDo this. Find a "rockstar" developer on the web who you know without a doubt is an expert and developing things similar to your product. This is who you would hire to build your product if money was no object. But remember, you\'re just hiring her for 2 hours. Her hourly rate will be expensive. Email her and then try calling her up. Pay for an hour long session before you look for candidates to get an idea of who you want to find. Then pay her for another session again after you have at least 5 candidates and are ready to pull the trigger.\r\n\r\nI could (and should) write a whole book on this, but here is a quick run-down of what to do.\r\n<h4>1. Prepare: Get your stuff together</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Do market research online to make sure your idea is worth pursuing and there are people ready to buy your product</li>\r\n	<li>Make rough sketches of your product</li>\r\n	<li>Figure out the budget for your product</li>\r\n	<li>Figure out a rough timeline</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>2. First Session: Questions</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>What skills should my developer have to do this project?</li>\r\n	<li>What are the basic process needed for a project like this? (i.e. design &gt; frontend &gt; backend &gt; testing &gt; launch)</li>\r\n	<li>Which Platform/Language do you recommend for this project? i.e. Rails, Wordpress, Shopify, Magento, Objective C, Django, .NET, Java, etc. (You want to use the right platform for the project, not just whatever platform your developer happens to use)</li>\r\n	<li>For what reasons do you recommend this platform?</li>\r\n	<li>Where can I find good (insert platform) developers? Do you have a developer you would recommend?</li>\r\n	<li>Ask any questions about anything you don\'t understand. Ask as many questions as you can!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>3. Candidates: Find &amp; Interview</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Decide whether you want a remote developer or if you want to limit yourself to local</li>\r\n	<li>Find them online or from recommendation</li>\r\n	<li>Email them and request an estimate of cost &amp; time for your project. (Attach sketches)</li>\r\n	<li>Also ask to see their work (pay attention to their writing skills).</li>\r\n	<li>Call them. Ask them some questions that require an in depth response. (pay attention to their verbal communication skills)</li>\r\n	<li>Look at their GitHub.com account to see what "open source" projects they love to work on</li>\r\n	<li>Ask for references to call (I know this is old school but it works).</li>\r\n	<li>Ask references if they meet deadlines and budgets.</li>\r\n	<li>Years of experience don\'t matter</li>\r\n	<li>Don\'t be fooled by the hourly rate. It means nothing. Ask them a range of hours that it would take to complete project so you can get an idea of total cost.</li>\r\n	<li>Rule out anyone who is bad at communicating</li>\r\n	<li>Rule out anyone who is not excited to teach you about things you don\'t understand</li>\r\n	<li>Rule out anyone who you wouldn\'t enjoy interacting with a lot</li>\r\n	<li>Rule out anyone who is not passionate.</li>\r\n	<li>Narrow down to 3-5 developers</li>\r\n	<li>Meet them each in person for 30 minute interviews to get a feel for them</li>\r\n	<li>Compile all profiles, contact info, previous work, github urls, etc for each candidate, and email for your rockstar. (Make it easy to quickly move through their work and see what caliber of developer they are)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>4. Second Session: Questions</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>After viewing all candidates, which developer would be best for my project?</li>\r\n	<li>For what reasons is this developer the best choice?</li>\r\n	<li>Should I go along with _____\'s pricing and billing methods or propose a different payment structure?</li>\r\n	<li>My gut is telling me Bob, do you think he is a good pick?</li>\r\n	<li>Why or why wouldn\'t Bob be a good pick?</li>\r\n	<li>Ask every valuable question that comes to your mind.</li>\r\n	<li>It will be very clear at this point, and you will at least have it narrowed down to 1 or 2.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>5. Trial Run: Hire for pre-project</h4>\r\nNext hire the chosen developer for a mini-project. Regardless of who you pick, always do a pre-project if it\'s the first time working with someone. Take a small part of your large project and break it off into a mini-project that will have it\'s own budget and deadline. This is where the rubber meets the road and you can see if the developer is good to work with or not. Odds are if they\'ve been vetted by your rockstar it will be fine, but if not you can make your way down the list to the next best person.\r\n<h4>6. Make It Official: Hire to build your product</h4>\r\nNow that you\'ve completed the first pre-project and know that it\'s a good fit, it\'s time to dive in and get stuff done. You know that you can trust them. Your "rockstar" developer trusts them. Let\'s build this product! Sell it. Give customers what they are wanting and reap the benefits in the process.\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\nYou now have a great Ruby developer who is partnering with you on your product. She is keeping you in the know about everything and letting you know what to expect along the way. You know what her skills are and at least a little bit about everything they handle for you. You understand more than half of the acronyms now because she has been teaching you along the way. You know your using a Ruby On Rails backend platform with an API that talks to your iOS and Android app seamlessly. You also have a neutral third party who can help you decipher the state of your product when you get confused. You are able to focus on your customers now, the ones who really matter.

Also you know that you don\'t want to spend months or years learning how to code, so you\'ve decided to leverage the talents of a developer.\r\n\r\nYou can\'t quite afford the hot-shot developers at the agency downtown so you instinctually go to Craigslist or Elance and begin your search for the "right" freelance developer. You might even ask some friends for some contacts. You find someone who seems good enough and has a "great" rate. Hooray! You\'re good to go. You send the guy the deposit funds to start and the anticipation of the glorious outcome continues to build.\r\n<h3>The Aftermath</h3>\r\nSix months and thousands of dollars later, you still have no product to ship. Or if you do, the product is so buggy and expensive to maintain that your baby business is already fading fast. You\'re getting words like API, SQL, SSL, Gem, UX, SEO, Validation, Backend, Frontend, Analytics and CMS thrown at you. But you are totally in the dark about what\'s going on or what your contractor is actually doing. You\'re getting surprise invoices left and right for thousands of dollars. You have very few customers, if any, and the one\'s you do have are very unhappy. You\'re grand idea that was supposed to make you a fortune (or at least a living) is now an endless nightmare hobby that has sucked all the passion (and money) from you.\r\n\r\nYou now ask yourself, "Did I hire the right guy to do this?". It would seem like the catastrophe happened either because your idea was bad or because it was executed poorly by your developer. The self-centeredness in us all goes right to the developer as the scapegoat. "It\'s definitely their fault" (Even though the odds are your idea had some holes in it too). But the truth is, whether you blame your idea or your hired gun (or both), this all could\'ve been avoided by you.

You should see a black command-line screen once opened\r\n<h3>2. Setup Git</h3>\r\nTo setup Git on your computer, type these in the command-line ($ signifies that this is a command, don’t type the $):\r\n<pre>$ git config --global user.name “Ty Richards”</pre>\r\n<pre>$ git config --global user.name   # to confirm name saved</pre>\r\n<pre>$ git config --global user.email “me@tyrichards.com”</pre>\r\n<pre>$ git config --global user.email   # to confirm email saved</pre>\r\n<h3>3.

Or are you familiar with Twitter Bootstrap but having trouble get it up and running in Rails? What if you could speed up front-end styling by 5-10x? Imagine you could have a nice looking starting point for the style of your web app with little to no work. What if you could customize colors, fonts, button sizes, padding sizes, background colors, link colors, add icons, responsive behavior etc, etc. within seconds and write little to no CSS? With <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> &amp; <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a> you can accomplish this and a lot more.\r\n\r\nFollow these quick steps and you’ll be up and running with Bootstrap &amp; Sass in no time:\r\n<h3>1. Add Gem</h3>\r\nGo to your rails app directory, open your <code>/Gemfile</code> and add:\r\n<pre>gem ‘bootstrap-sass’, ‘~&gt; 3.2.0’ # or whatever the latest version is</pre>\r\n<h3>2. Bundle Install</h3>\r\nAlways run bundle install in terminal after you add a new gem to install it\r\n\r\nIn command-line\r\n<pre>$ cd /your/rails/project/path/\r\n$ bundle install</pre>\r\n<h3>3. Create Style File</h3>\r\nCreate the file <code>style.css.scss</code> here:\r\n<code>/app/assets/stylesheets/style.css.scss</code>\r\n\r\n<small>Note: <code>.sass</code> and <code>.scss</code> are both considered Sass files but <code>.scss</code> files work with the newer syntax that you will likely want to stick with.</small>\r\n\r\n<small>Note (again): <code>.css.scss</code> double extension tells rails to compile the scss to css</small>\r\n<h3>4. Import Bootstrap CSS</h3>\r\nAdd line to top of the new <code>style.css.scss</code> file\r\n<pre>@import ‘bootstrap’; #adds bootstrap styles to the file</pre>\r\n<h3>5. Restart Rails Server</h3>\r\n<pre>cd /your/project/directory/ # or go to your current rails server window\r\n$ ctrl-C # if you have rails server running currently\r\n$ rails server</pre>\r\n<h3>6. Add Bootstrap Javascript</h3>\r\nOpen /app/assets/javascripts/application.js and add:\r\n<pre>//= require query\r\n//= require jquery_ujs\r\n//= require bootstrap  # note that it’s important for bootstrap to be required AFTER query\r\n…</pre>\r\n<h3>7. Add Viewport to <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tags</h3>\r\nOpen <code>/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb</code> and replace viewport meta tags with this:\r\n<pre>&lt;head&gt;\r\n...\r\n&lt;meta name=“viewport” content=“width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0”&gt;\r\n...\r\n&lt;/head&gt;</pre>\r\n<h3>8. Add Bootstrap Classes</h3>\r\nYou can now add bootstrap elements to pages by adding css classes to your elements to change the style\r\n<pre>&lt;%= link_to “Learn More”, “#yourlink”, class: “btn btn-primary” %&gt; # makes the link a btn with the main brand color</pre>\r\nbecomes\r\n<pre>&lt;a href=“#” class=“btn btn-primary"&gt;Learn More&lt;/a&gt;</pre>\r\nNow you can go into your rails views and add styled <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar" target="_blank">navbars</a>, <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons" target="_blank">buttons</a>, <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms" target="_blank">forms</a>, and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#jumbotron" target="_blank">jumbotrons</a> with little effort. Bootstrap is also extremely helpful with a <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid" target="_blank">responsive grid</a> that works right out of the box. If you are new to Bootstrap, checkout their <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples" target="_blank">examples</a>. They can be helpful for getting started.\r\n\r\nIf I am throwing something quick together or working on a high-end custom-designed site, I use Bootstrap &amp; Sass as a starting point because it is so rapid and moldable.\r\n\r\nThe <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap site</a> has a complete list of classes &amp; documentation\r\n<h3>9. Add Bootstrap Variables</h3>\r\nHere\'s where the magic happens. In your <code>style.css.scss</code> file you can also add Sass variables for even quicker development\r\n\r\nVariables:\r\n<pre>$brand-primary: #2ecc71\r\n$brand-success: #5cb85c;\r\n$body-bg: #222222;\r\n$text-color: #95a5a6;\r\n$link-color:  $brand-primary;\r\n@import ‘bootstrap’; # variables must be above main bootstrap import</pre>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Variables:</strong> You can use this list of all <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/customize/#variables-basics" target="_blank">Bootstrap variables</a>\r\n<small>Note: if you use the bootstrap list of variables, be sure to replace the <code>@</code> with <code>$</code>. <code>@</code> is for Less and <code>$</code> is for Sass.</small></li>\r\n	<li><strong>Colors:</strong> I use <a href="http://flatuicolor.com" target="_blank">Flat UI Colors</a> as a starting point for color scheme and go from there.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat\'s it!  Keep in mind this will get you jump started but there are definitely more sophisticated Sass setups that will keep your variables and style code separate and more organized. There are also many more tips for Bootstrap. I could do a whole set of posts on the responsive grid and how to use columns the right way.\r\n\r\nMore on this later.

Ever have a client ask you to put things back how they were 2 weeks ago? Or do you have a hard time collaborating with other developers?\r\n\r\nImagine you can rewind or revert to any stage in development at the drop of a hat. And when it’s time to work on a risky or experimental feature you could get messy without affecting the main source code of the project. Imagine it is simple and straight forward to collaborate with other devs on your team without stepping on each others toes. For these and a million other reasons, you need to use Git! Git is a small but powerful tool vital to any Rails developer. If you are new to Rails and are ready to usher in a new age for yourself, it’s best to just jump on the Git bandwagon right away so you’ve got a leg to stand on.\r\n\r\nNote: Their is a distinction between Git and Github. Although related and used in tandem, it’s important to know that Git is the version control system on your local computer and Github is  a web-based hosting service. We will focus on Git\r\n\r\nHere’s a fast track to getting setup with Git:\r\n<h3>1. Open Terminal</h3>\r\nFind the application called Terminal on your Mac (or Windows Equivalent) and open it. You should see a black command-line screen once opened\r\n<h3>2. Setup Git</h3>\r\nTo setup Git on your computer, type these in the command-line ($ signifies that this is a command, don’t type the $):\r\n<pre>$ git config --global user.name “Ty Richards”</pre>\r\n<pre>$ git config --global user.name   # to confirm name saved</pre>\r\n<pre>$ git config --global user.email “me@tyrichards.com”</pre>\r\n<pre>$ git config --global user.email   # to confirm email saved</pre>\r\n<h3>3. Create New Repo</h3>\r\nTo setup a Git repo for a new project or give an existing project a repo:\r\n<pre>$ cd ~/Sites/new_project  # travel to your new project folder in terminal</pre>\r\n<pre>$ pwd   # verify that you are in that directory</pre>\r\n<pre>$ git init  # creates a new repo</pre>\r\n<pre>$ git status # to see what files are being tracked$ git add .  # adds all files in current folder)</pre>\r\n<pre>$ git commit -a -m “initial commit”  # commits all(-a) modified files and includes a message(-m)</pre>\r\n<h3>4. Do Stuff</h3>\r\nAfter every task you do you can:\r\n<pre>$ git status # to see what is being tracked and modified</pre>\r\n<pre>$ git add .</pre>\r\n<pre>$ git commit -am “Build initial scaffolding”</pre>\r\nand repeat\r\n\r\nWith this you’ll be setup and ready to go in the era of Git. At it’s best you have full control of your source code revisions and collaboration, and at worst you have a nicely documented history of revisions that have been made on the project. There are many more advanced features of Git and GitHub makes things more exciting too. With Git you also need to understand branches, remotes, and the .gitignore file, but you are at least jumpstarted into the world of Git.

Also it was a beat-down to transfer and backup projects to a place where I could always access them from anywhere. That was until I discovered <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a>.\r\n\r\nNow I push all my projects to an online repository. I see a real-time history of all my projects. I easily collaborate and contribute to other\'s projects, and get instant access to my source code whenever I need it. Github also serves as a social network of sorts for developers. In a glance others can see what I\'m working on and I can explore to see what my friends are working on. This is all part of the modern web/software developer\'s repertoire  (especially Rails), along with <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a>.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that Github and Git are related but different things. Git is a local version control tool for your projects, and Github is online hosting of your project source code.\r\n\r\nSo what\'s the best way to get started with Github? Follow these steps and you\'ll be rolling.\r\n<h3>1. Setup Git</h3>\r\nGit is required to be able to use Github, so if you haven\'t read my post <em><a title="Get going with Git" href="http://dev.railsvitamins.com/get-going-with-git/">Get going with Git</a></em>, go there first and setup Git on your local computer.\r\n<h3>2. Make initial commit</h3>\r\nOnce you\'ve setup Git on your computer. Find an existing project that you want to put on Github or create a new folder for an upcoming project. Then open terminal and enter the following:\r\n<pre>$ cd /path/to/your/project/ # change to the directory of your project\r\n$ git init # create local repository\r\n$ git add . # add all files in the directory\r\n$ git commit -am "Initial Commit" # commit with a message</pre>\r\nYou now have a local repository with your new or existing project. How do we push this to Github? Continue on...\r\n<h3>3. Start Github account</h3>\r\nGo to <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">github.com</a> and setup your account.\r\n<h3>4. Create a new repo</h3>\r\nOnce you are setup and logged in:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Click on the <code>+</code> sign in the top right hand corner</li>\r\n	<li>Click <code>New repository</code> from the dropdown</li>\r\n	<li>Give repo a name like <code>my_project</code>, <code>my-project</code>, or <code>MyProject</code> (I like to pick a convention and stick with it).</li>\r\n	<li>Give your project a description</li>\r\n	<li>Choose <code>Public</code> or <code>Private</code>.\r\n<small>Stick with public right now unless you are doing a company/client project (they might not like you publishing their source code for the world to see). Public repos are free. Private repos will cost you a little. I use them myself though.</small></li>\r\n	<li>I usually leave the <code>Initialize this repo with a README</code> unchecked because Rails projects have these by default when you setup a rails project.</li>\r\n	<li>Then click the <code>Create Repository</code> Button</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>5. Push Local Git Repo to Github Repo</h3>\r\nAfter your Github repo is created you will see a screen with setup instructions. Skip down to the <code>Push an existing repository from the command line</code> section. Type the following into the command line on your local machine:\r\n<pre>git remote add origin git@github.com:MyAccount/my_project.git\r\ngit push -u origin master</pre>\r\nYou have now set your new Github repo as the origin "remote" repository (more on remotes later). And you have set the ability to push your <em>local</em> Git repo to your <em>remote</em> Github repo.\r\n<h3>6. Do the Git Jive</h3>\r\nNow you can work on your project, make changes, and do the Git dance.\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Work on stuff</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n<pre>$ git add .</pre>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n<pre>$ git commit -am "Create Navbar"</pre>\r\n<small>Note: Best practice for commits is to write in present tense and keep it short</small></li>\r\n	<li>\r\n<pre>$ git push</pre>\r\n<small>Pushes to Github repo</small></li>\r\n	<li>Repeat</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>7. Bonus</h3>\r\nI was going to save this for another post, but it\'s too much fun. Now that your Github repo is setup for your project you can pull up your project from any computer in a jiffy (as long as it has Git setup on it). You can actually do this with anyone\'s public project on Github. This is called <em>cloning</em>, and it does just that. Just open the directory where you want to drop it on your local machine and clone the repo to download the project instantly. The quickest way to clone a project is to find the project repo on Github and copy the clone code on the righthand side here:\r\n\r\n<a href="http://dev.railsvitamins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Git-Clone.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-80" src="http://dev.railsvitamins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Git-Clone-300x183.jpg" alt="Git Clone" width="500" height="306" /></a>\r\n\r\nThen travel to the directory you want to drop it and type <code>$ git clone</code> and paste the clone text in like so:\r\n<pre>$ cd /path/to/new/project/destination/\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:MyAccount/my_project.git</pre>\r\nFeel free to dig around Github and find other amazing developers with fun projects and clone theirs too to dig through their code.\r\n\r\nThere are a thousand other more advanced techniques I will cover with Git/Github including branches, remotes and deploying your Rails app, but you can hit the ground running now. With this jump start you can keep your code in an online repo, share what you are working on with others, easily collaborate, and interact with other humans. Congrats you\'re now a <em>modern</em> developer living in the 21st century!', 'Hop on the Github bandwagon', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'hop-on-the-github-bandwagon', '', '', '2014-08-06 13:13:51', '2014-08-06 18:13:51', '', 0, 'http://dev.railsvitamins.com/?p=73', 0, 'post', '', 0) ;

This is all part of the modern web/software developer\'s repertoire  (especially Rails), along with <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a>.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that Github and Git are related but different things. Git is a local version control tool for your projects, and Github is online hosting of your project source code.\r\n\r\nSo what\'s the best way to get started with Github? Follow these steps and you\'ll be rolling.\r\n<h3>1. Setup Git</h3>\r\nGit is required to be able to use Github, so if you haven\'t read my post <em><a title="Get going with Git" href="http://dev.railsvitamins.com/get-going-with-git/">Get going with Git</a></em>, go there first.\r\n<h3>2. Make initial commit</h3>\r\nFind an existing project that you want to put on Github or create a new folder for an upcoming project.\r\n\r\n$ cd /path/to/your/project/ # change to the directory of your project\r\n$ git init # create local repository\r\n$ git add . # add all files in the directory\r\n$ git commit -am "Initial Commit" # commit with a message\r\n\r\nYou now have a local repository with your new or existing project. How do we push this to Github? Continue on...\r\n<h3>3. Start Github account</h3>\r\nGo to <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">github.com</a> and setup your account.\r\n<h3>4. Create a new repo</h3>\r\nOnce you are setup and logged in:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Click on the <code>+</code> sign in the top right hand corner</li>\r\n	<li>Click "New repository" from the dropdown</li>\r\n	<li>Give repo a name like <code>my_project</code>, <code>my-project</code>, or <code>MyProject</code> (I like to pick a convention and stick with it).</li>\r\n	<li>Give your project a description</li>\r\n	<li>Choose Public or Private.\r\nStick with public right now unless you are doing a company/client project (they might not like you publishing their source code for the world to see).

Setup Git</h3>\r\nGit is required to be able to use Github, so if you haven\'t read my post <em><a title="Get going with Git" href="http://dev.railsvitamins.com/get-going-with-git/">Get going with Git</a></em>, go there first and setup Git on your local computer.\r\n<h3>2. Make initial commit</h3>\r\nOnce you\'ve setup Git on your computer. Find an existing project that you want to put on Github or create a new folder for an upcoming project. Then open terminal and enter the following:\r\n<pre>$ cd /path/to/your/project/ # change to the directory of your project\r\n$ git init # create local repository\r\n$ git add . # add all files in the directory\r\n$ git commit -am "Initial Commit" # commit with a message</pre>\r\nYou now have a local repository with your new or existing project. How do we push this to Github? Continue on...\r\n<h3>3. Start Github account</h3>\r\nGo to <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">github.com</a> and setup your account.\r\n<h3>4. Create a new repo</h3>\r\nOnce you are setup and logged in:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Click on the <code>+</code> sign in the top right hand corner</li>\r\n	<li>Click <code>New repository</code> from the dropdown</li>\r\n	<li>Give repo a name like <code>my_project</code>, <code>my-project</code>, or <code>MyProject</code> (I like to pick a convention and stick with it).</li>\r\n	<li>Give your project a description</li>\r\n	<li>Choose <code>Public</code> or <code>Private</code>.\r\n<small>Stick with public right now unless you are doing a company/client project (they might not like you publishing their source code for the world to see). Public repos are free. Private repos will cost you a little. I use them myself though.</small></li>\r\n	<li>I usually leave the <code>Initialize this repo with a README</code> unchecked because Rails projects have these by default when you setup a rails project.</li>\r\n	<li>Then click the <code>Create Repository</code> Button</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>5. Push Local Git Repo to Github Repo</h3>\r\nAfter your Github repo is created you will see a screen with setup instructions. Skip down to the <code>Push an existing repository from the command line</code> section. Type the following into the command line on your local machine:\r\n<pre>git remote add origin git@github.com:MyAccount/my_project.git\r\ngit push -u origin master</pre>\r\n<h3>6. The Git Jive</h3>\r\nNow you can work on your project, make changes, and do the Git dance.\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Work on stuff</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n<pre>$ git add .</pre>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n<pre>$ git commit -am "Create Navbar"</pre>\r\n<small>Note: Best practice for commits is to write in present tense and keep it short</small></li>\r\n	<li>\r\n<pre>$ git push</pre>\r\n<small>Pushes to Github repo</small></li>\r\n	<li>Repeat</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>7. Bonus</h3>\r\nI was going to save this for another post, but it\'s too much fun. Now that your Github repo is setup for your project you can pull up your project from any computer in a jiffy (as long as it has Git setup on it). You can actually do this with anyone\'s public project on Github. This is called <em>cloning</em>, and it does just that. Just open the directory where you want to drop it on your local machine and clone the repo to download the project instantly. The quickest way to clone a project is to find the project repo on Github and copy/paste the clone code on the righthand side here:\r\n\r\n<a href="http://dev.railsvitamins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Git-Clone.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-80" src="http://dev.railsvitamins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Git-Clone-300x183.jpg" alt="Git Clone" width="300" height="183" /></a>\r\n<pre>$ cd /path/to/new/project/destination/\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:MyAccount/my_project.git</pre>\r\nCongrats you\'re now a <em>modern</em> developer living in the 21st century!

This is all part of the modern web/software developer\'s repertoire  (especially Rails), along with <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a>.\n\nKeep in mind that Github and Git are related but different things. Git is a local version control tool for your projects, and Github is online hosting of your project source code.\n\nSo what\'s the best way to get started with Github? Follow these steps and you\'ll be rolling.\n<h3>1. Setup Git</h3>\nGit is required to be able to use Github, so if you haven\'t read my post <em><a title="Get going with Git" href="http://dev.railsvitamins.com/get-going-with-git/">Get going with Git</a></em>, go there first and setup Git on your local computer.\n<h3>2. Make initial commit</h3>\nOnce you\'ve setup Git on your computer. Find an existing project that you want to put on Github or create a new folder for an upcoming project. Then open terminal and enter the following:\n<pre>$ cd /path/to/your/project/ # change to the directory of your project\n$ git init # create local repository\n$ git add . # add all files in the directory\n$ git commit -am "Initial Commit" # commit with a message</pre>\nYou now have a local repository with your new or existing project. How do we push this to Github? Continue on...\n<h3>3. Start Github account</h3>\nGo to <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">github.com</a> and setup your account.\n<h3>4. Create a new repo</h3>\nOnce you are setup and logged in:\n<ul>\n	<li>Click on the <code>+</code> sign in the top right hand corner</li>\n	<li>Click <code>New repository</code> from the dropdown</li>\n	<li>Give repo a name like <code>my_project</code>, <code>my-project</code>, or <code>MyProject</code> (I like to pick a convention and stick with it).</li>\n	<li>Give your project a description</li>\n	<li>Choose <code>Public</code> or <code>Private</code>.\n<small>Stick with public right now unless you are doing a company/client project (they might not like you publishing their source code for the world to see). Public repos are free. Private repos will cost you a little. I use them myself though.</small></li>\n	<li>I usually leave the <code>Initialize this repo with a README</code> unchecked because Rails projects have these by default when you setup a rails project.</li>\n	<li>Then click the <code>Create Repository</code> Button</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>5. Push Local Git Repo to Github Repo</h3>\nAfter your Github repo is created you will see a screen with setup instructions. Skip down to the <code>Push an existing repository from the command line</code> section. Type the following into the command line on your local machine:\n<pre>git remote add origin git@github.com:MyAccount/my_project.git\ngit push -u origin master</pre>\nYou have now set your new Github repo as the origin "remote" repository (more on remotes later). And you have set the ability to push your <em>local</em> Git repo to your <em>remote</em> Github repo.\n<h3>6. Do the Git Jive</h3>\nNow you can work on your project, make changes, and do the Git dance.\n<ol>\n	<li>Work on stuff</li>\n	<li>\n<pre>$ git add .</pre>\n</li>\n	<li>\n<pre>$ git commit -am "Create Navbar"</pre>\n<small>Note: Best practice for commits is to write in present tense and keep it short</small></li>\n	<li>\n<pre>$ git push</pre>\n<small>Pushes to Github repo</small></li>\n	<li>Repeat</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>7. Bonus</h3>\nI was going to save this for another post, but it\'s too much fun.

Is the learning-curve impossibly steep? Everyone says that learning Rails is sooo easy, but you\'ve been banging your head against the desk for months trying to figure it out. Are you drowning in a sea of error messages? As you know by now, they can wash your dream app down the drain and bring months of hard work to a screeching halt.\r\n\r\nDo you learn by doing? Are you tired of studying abstract programming concepts and syntax without actually applying them to a real app?\r\n\r\nHave you burned piles of money and time on books and courses to be left with absolutely nothing? A lot of Rails books &amp; courses take forever to get through and then leave you high and dry with no skills or finished product. Is your brain flat-lining because you are forced to digest too many confusing programming concepts at once? Even the books that say they are for beginners are mind-numbing. And with endless copy &amp; pasting, they end up reducing you to a transcriptionist monkey. You are left in a foggy blur and you don\'t retain the material. Plus many of the resources are horribly out-of-date and almost never go picture-perfect like they are written.\r\n\r\nLet\'s face it, you need progress to stay motivated and learn Rails. Progress is the fuel that keeps you going. So a lack of it can really beat you down. I know it has for me. Do you wish there was a better way to learn Rails, but fear that there isn’t? It shouldn\'t be this difficult.\r\n\r\nYou are certain that you want to build your idea. You just aren\'t sure that you can do it. Maybe it\'s a lost cause. Perhaps you should save yourself the trouble and leave it alone.\r\n\r\nDREAM\r\n\r\nImagine you could make and launch your own Ruby on Rails app in a matter of days with little knowledge of coding. I know it sounds crazy, but seriously. What would it be like if Rails\' steep learning curve was suddenly flattened? If nothing stood in the way of you learning Rails and getting your app shipped?\r\n\r\nYou could keep your precious precious sanity, that\'s for sure. You would know exactly where to start learning and what was next. And getting stuck with error messages would be a thing of the past. You could soar through building your Rails app and cut through error messages like they were butter.\r\n\r\nYou wouldn\'t have to throw away thousands on a Computer Science degree or Code School. And you wouldn\'t need to find yourself a technical co-founder or hire that expensive developer. And huzzah, you could push your app live for the world to enjoy, without a hitch.\r\n\r\nYou could finally make REAL traction and get \'er done. If you had a Rails fast track, you could save months (or in my case - years) of wasted time. Not to mention you could avoid a ton of unnecessary pain and heartache.\r\n\r\nThen the dream of making AND shipping your app could finally come true.\r\n\r\nIf Rails was a piece o\' cake to pick up you could just learn by doing. Really doing. You\'d build a Rails app and easily absorb the concepts and details one by one as you move along. You\'d know exactly what to learn and you would learn it all in exactly the right order.  You could eat the elephant one concept at a time, even in the midst of a wall of tasks, languages and syntax. And you\'d never wonder if you had up-to-date training.\r\n\r\nEven without being a "Computer Scientist", you\'d feel confident as you made a big-picture plan for your new app, wrote code at each step, and understood exactly what each line of code did and why it was there.

(100, 1, '2014-08-21 16:34:10', '2014-08-21 21:34:10', 'Want to learn to make your own web app with Ruby on Rails? Maybe you\'ve tried to learn Rails on your own, but how do you know where to start? Is the learning-curve impossibly steep? Everyone says that learning Rails is sooo easy, but you\'ve been banging your head against the desk for months trying to figure it out. Are you drowning in a sea of error messages? As you know by now, they can wash your dream app down the drain and bring months of hard work to a screeching halt.\r\n\r\nDo you learn by doing? Are you tired of studying abstract programming concepts and syntax without actually applying them to a real app?\r\n\r\nHave you burned piles of money and time on books and courses to be left with absolutely nothing? A lot of Rails books &amp; courses take forever to get through and then leave you high and dry with no skills or finished product. Is your brain flat-lining because you are forced to digest too many confusing programming concepts at once? Even the books that say they are for beginners are mind-numbing. And with endless copy &amp; pasting, they end up reducing you to a transcriptionist monkey. You are left in a foggy blur and you don\'t retain the material. Plus many of the resources are horribly out-of-date and almost never go picture-perfect like they are written.\r\n\r\nLet\'s face it, you need progress to stay motivated and learn Rails. Progress is the fuel that keeps you going. So a lack of it can really beat you down. I know it has for me. Do you wish there was a better way to learn Rails, but fear that there isn’t? It shouldn\'t be this difficult.\r\n\r\nYou are certain that you want to build your idea. You just aren\'t sure that you can do it. Maybe it\'s a lost cause. Perhaps you should save yourself the trouble and leave it alone.\r\n\r\nDREAM\r\n\r\nImagine you could make and launch your own Ruby on Rails app in a matter of days with little knowledge of coding. I know it sounds crazy, but seriously. What would it be like if Rails\' steep learning curve was suddenly flattened? If nothing stood in the way of you learning Rails and getting your app shipped?\r\n\r\nYou could keep your precious precious sanity, that\'s for sure. You would know exactly where to start learning and what was next. And getting stuck with error messages would be a thing of the past. You could soar through building your Rails app and cut through error messages like they were butter.\r\n\r\nYou wouldn\'t have to throw away thousands on a Computer Science degree or Code School. And you wouldn\'t need to find yourself a technical co-founder or hire that expensive developer. And huzzah, you could push your app live for the world to enjoy, without a hitch.\r\n\r\nYou could finally make REAL traction and get \'er done. If you had a Rails fast track, you could save months (or in my case - years) of wasted time. Not to mention you could avoid a ton of unnecessary pain and heartache.\r\n\r\nThen the dream of making AND shipping your app could finally come true.\r\n\r\nIf Rails was a piece o\' cake to pick up you could just learn by doing. Really doing. You\'d build a Rails app and easily absorb the concepts and details one by one as you move along. You\'d know exactly what to learn and you would learn it all in exactly the right order.  You could eat the elephant one concept at a time, even in the midst of a wall of tasks, languages and syntax. And you\'d never wonder if you had up-to-date training.\r\n\r\nEven without being a "Computer Scientist", you\'d feel confident as you made a big-picture plan for your new app, wrote code at each step, and understood exactly what each line of code did and why it was there. Hell, at this rate you would actually enjoy coding.</div>\r\n\r\n<div id="magicdomid294" data-author-initials="TR" data-author-name="Ty R" data-author-link="/ep/profile/CuI93BRZFA7">By quickly stacking up tiny victories with Rails you could move yourself closer and closer to the big win of building and shipping your app for the world to see.
